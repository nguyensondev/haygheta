00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.930
We humans are miserable creatures.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.590
We reject what we fear.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.800
We attack because we don't understand.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.470
Human cowardice...

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.970
...breeds war.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.580
I know.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.100
You're scared too...

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.150
...aren't you ?

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.950
Are you human or a Corpses?!

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.550
I'm neither!

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.550
I'm a Corpseless!

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.350
I will remember that day

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.350
Losing myself

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.650
In steam

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.500
Countless mistakes are made

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.900
When I can't see anything ahead

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.700
You said

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.200
"Ask your own burning blood"

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.450
Answer my beat

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.000
Corpseless of the Koutetsujou

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.950
Stand up

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.450
And slam everything onto the ground

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.700
My soul is devoted to my friend

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.400
Burn your life

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.450
Change the world

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.800
Last
Chapter

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.800
Iron
Fortress

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.910
Ikoma, this side has been taken care of.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.180
Hey... Ikoma?

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.500
Ikoma....

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.950
...what are you?

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.920
I'm a... Corpseless.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.900
If you fully turn into a Corpse
and lose what makes you human...

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.550
...then I will kill you, I promise.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.910
So you're saying Nameless
can be saved with the white blood?

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.740
That's right.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.520
It will be able to undo
the black blood's effects.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.900
But with only one left, you can only save
either yourself or Nameless, not both.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.050
Either way, you have to hurry.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.870
It's only a matter of time
before it takes your mind.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.310
Wait for me, Nameless!

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.200
They brought the virus here!

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.550
Set them on fire!

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.320
Die! Die!

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.820
Stop immediately!

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.950
Ayame-sama!

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.340
Thank goodness you're okay!

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.390
They are not the Corpses.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.660
Like we could believe that!

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.850
It's your duty to maintain order!

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.600
No.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.650
Order exists to protect the people.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.000
We must not aim our guns
at the wrong people.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.750
What we should eliminate...

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.170
...are our doubting hearts and minds!

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.070
We are going to escape
from Diamond Citadel.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.900
Please join us.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.700
Why are you alive?

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.950
You tilled so many...

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.030
You can die too!

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:58.050
Yes.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.000
We believe she'll make it to
the castle tower in roughly 30 minutes.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.470
I got it.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.200
We'll meet on platform 13 to evacuate.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.650
Understood.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.790
It... can't be...

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.400
What should I...

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.500
...destroy next?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.800
Young Master.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.040
Corpseless!

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.200
Don't let him near the castle tower!

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.930
Get out of my way!

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.600
I'm only here for Nameless and Biba!

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:36.850
Sahari-sama!

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.900
He may have the body of a Corpses...

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.650
...but his head is still human.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.790
Sahari-sama!

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.660
Stop the stray Corpseless!

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.150
In that case, it's only
a matter of crushing him...

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.800
...with greater power!

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.890
I will not allow you to
interfere with our plans!

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.550
This is where you die!

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.200
Ikoma!

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.430
Ikoma.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.650
Don't worry...

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.070
...I'm still a Corpseless.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:04.800
How dare you...

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.300
...interfere with Young Master's and my plans?

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.700
You killed too many!

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.550
After all that damage...

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:34.200
...he still does not break?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.750
Ikoma...

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.000
Young Master.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.100
The Corpses are spreading
faster than we had anticipated.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.660
Please take this if
the worst should happen.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.940
Is he the next one you
want me to kill, commander?

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.290
No, you save our people.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:56.910
Once this is all over...

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.150
...you will take everyone and escape.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:00.650
What about you?

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.400
I must go...

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.350
A dying man...

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.600
...is calling me.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.190
Kurusu!

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.460
Kurusu!

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200
I'm fine!

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.730
Go, Corpseless!

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.650
Nameless...

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.690
I have to be strong in order to live.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.450
The weak part of me can never return.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.100
Not anywhere...

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.400
Isn't that right...

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.100
...brother?

00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.750
Nameless...

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:01.700
...wait for me.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.900
I'm coming... to save you!

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:08.650
Nameless!

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.350
Ikoma?

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.850
I'm going to turn you back now!

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:52.700
Biba!

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.300
I've been waiting...

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.200
...for a soul that knew no fear.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.250
And I am here...

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.950
...to hunt it.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.220
Get out of my way.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.290
Biba!

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.020
Judging from your appearance...
you must have used the black blood.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.190
What is it you seek that you
would sacrifice so much?

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.150
I...

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.590
...promised to turn Nameless human again!

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.860
That's all!

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.300
Ikoma...

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.350
...are you there?

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:08.160
Biba...

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.200
...I have to end you with my own hands...

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:12.950
I...!

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.250
Biba...

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.750
...I will kill you...

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.180
Kill you.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.650
So you have found...

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.700
...a coward.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:55.500
Nameless!

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.350
Are you there?!

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.160
Live...

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:02.700
...Nameless!

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.450
Stop, brother!

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.900
What are you doing?

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.150
Get up, Ikoma.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.670
As you can see, I am still standing!

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:27.900
Fight...

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.280
...Ikoma!

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.450
Nameless...

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.040
I told you to stop.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.450
I wish you would listen
to me sometimes... brother.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.520
We are going to live
even though we're weak.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.100
We're going to make rice paddies together...

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.020
...and strive for a future
where we can all eat rice.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.750
So... I'm sorry...

00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:59.200
...brother.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.150
I see...

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.500
...Nameless.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:05.680
No.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.230
I'm... Hozumi.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.100
It's going to be okay!

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.200
There's enough room for everyone!

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.160
Don't panic!

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:28.890
We should be able to go
there following line six.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.700
There's no guarantee
that the railway is intact.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.120
But there has to be a path.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.190
Biba would have left a railway for his escape.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.290
Would you like me to tell you?

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.520
You're...!

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.090
Let's make a deal.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.750
In exchange for telling you the escape route...

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.450
...you let us on the Iron Fortress.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.150
You must be joking!

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.650
Like we would ever accept that!

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:04.550
Let us cooperate.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.850
Ayame-sama!

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.850
They are suffering as well.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.610
Or else they would be
using force to have us comply.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.390
Thanks, princess.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.120
I'll tell you something good for that.

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.630
The stray Corpseless and
your loyal dog are both here.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.570
Nameless. You have turned back.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.450
Ikoma!

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.100
What are you?!

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.000
Ikoma!

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.700
Kurusu, he's going to be okay, isn't he?

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.900
I was able to turn back,
so Ikoma should too!

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.370
Tell me, Ikoma.

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:50.260
What should I do?

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.930
I'll cut down a million
Corpses if you ask me to.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.600
Nameless-chan, can you hear me?

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:01.990
Kajika?

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.760
Kurusu, Ikoma can you hear me?

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.780
I'm talking to you from the Iron Fortress.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.940
Signal is good.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.570
Come meet us on platform 13.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.200
We'll have the Iron Fortress head there now.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.350
I always get stuck with these jobs.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.690
Nameless-chan, we'll all be
waiting for you there!

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.160
Let's go.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.760
I still haven't gotten his answer yet.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.250
Master key confirmed.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:43.400
Ignite the boiler!

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.280
Nameless.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.800
Please, launch the Iron Fortress!

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.500
Out of my way!

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.920
Nameless-chan was saying that she
wanted to eat rice until she was full.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.350
To make a word where that can happen.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.590
Platform 13 is right up ahead.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:41.800
There!

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.800
It's Nameless and the others!

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.240
Yukina-san!

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:44.950
Yes!

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:49.430
It's the Iron Fortress!

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.500
Nameless-chan, this way!

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.500
Everyone get ready to catch them!

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.750
Ikoma...

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:08.290
...we're returned.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.450
You go first.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.200
I'm home!

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.740
Welcome back!

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:27.730
Kurusu!

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:37.540
Welcome back.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.040
I have returned.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.100
Get in!

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.100
Increasing speed.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:19.710
Ikoma.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.520
Hey, Ikoma!

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:23.880
Is he not waking up?

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.000
He's going to be fine!

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.740
Ikoma promised to turn me human again!

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.710
He hasn't done that yet!

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.180
Wake up!

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.080
Wake up, Ikoma!

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.350
Ikoma!

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.750
Ikoma!

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.750
Nameless-chan...

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.700
You're my shield, so you can't die!

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.610
Wake up! Wake up!

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:45.460
Ow...

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:48.950
Stop shaking me...

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.500
Ikoma!

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:56.600
What?

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.700
Nameless...

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.400
...you're okay.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.830
I'm supposed to say that to you.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:14.900
Was this...

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:16.750
...the white blood?

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.850
My brother did that?

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.360
Your body's fine?

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.050
Yup.

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:34.800
Oh, that's right.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:36.250
Ikoma.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:37.850
Here.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.050
You forgot this.
