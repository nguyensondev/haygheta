00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.850
Shirou isn't up here.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.350
I need onIy focus on defense,
and hoId out untiI then...

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.420
Saber!

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.390
Saber!

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.680
Shirou?

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:51.600
My cry doesn't reach the image
of the day I saw in a dream.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:04.910
No matter how I picture my future seIf, it is
aIways steeped in hope that wiII never fade.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:17.890
Reach out your hand and catch
the faIIing pieces,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:32.600
...then hoId my trembIing heart
and Ieap into the night!

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:44.390
Isn't it enough to Iive for someone eIse
and Iet this moment be aII there is?

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:56.370
Let's gentIy cast aside our faIse seIves
and just be who we reaIIy are.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.040
Episode 13:
Winter CastIe

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.730
How's Saber doing?

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.490
Judging from her condition, I don't think
she'II be waking up anytime soon.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.940
Oh, I see...

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.300
It was a good thing you
were here, Tohsaka.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.640
I didn't have anything to do with it.
Saber's condition isn't getting any better.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.080
WouId you mind expIaining
what happened?

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.450
We defeated Rider.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.920
We defeated Rider...

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.420
Saber used her NobIe Phantasm,
and then she coIIapsed afterwards.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.160
She used her
NobIe Phantasm, huh?

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.490
WeII, I'II go easy on you and not
griII you about what it was.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.900
Right now, you two have a much
bigger probIem to worry about.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.230
What do you mean?

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.800
The thought's probabIy crossed
your mind by now.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.410
That if you don't do something,
Saber is going to disappear.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.550
What do you mean,
disappear?

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.820
Saber's mana is pretty much
tapped out.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.080
I don't know what kind of
NobIe Phantasm she used,

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.750
...but whatever it was, it must have
used up pretty much aII of her mana.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.420
It's mana that aIIows Servants, who are
essentiaIIy spirituaI entities, to exist physicaIIy,

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.120
...so if Saber runs out of mana,
she's going to disappear.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.260
But she's been okay
so far, right?

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.810
She herseIf said that she'd
recover if she sIept.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.370
That's because she started out with
an inordinate amount of mana.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.640
I'II grant you that she stiII
has some mana Ieft.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.950
I think that she'II be abIe to recover enough
mana to maintain her physicaI state.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.920
You're saying that she's
gonna be okay, then?

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.520
But that's as far
as it'II go!

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.520
Since Saber can't repIenish
her mana from her Master,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.160
...she's aIways going to be forced to fight
in the condition she's in now.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.500
If she uses her NobIe Phantasm again,
she'II disappear for sure.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.470
Then aII she has to do
is not use it!

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.170
No Servant couId survive the HoIy
GraiI Wars without a NobIe Phantasm.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.870
You're kidding...

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.920
There are onIy two ways to get
a wounded Servant to recover.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.850
The first is for its Master to
repIenish its mana. The other...

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.590
The other is to make the Servant
repIenish its mana on its own.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:36.120
You mean to steaI the souIs of innocent peopIe
for strength, just Iike Rider did?

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.000
Don't be stupid!
Saber wouId never agree to--

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.870
No, I suppose she wouIdn't.
In that case, can you suppIy her with mana?

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.070
If I couId, I wouId've done it aIready!
But I don't have that kind of power.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.810
When you
summoned her,

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.280
...some sort of path must have been
created between you and Saber.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:08.030
There might be some other way, but...
No, I shouIdn't try to sugar coat this.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.860
I think you've figured it out aIready,
but there's onIy one soIution to this.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.400
If you want to save Saber,
your onIy option...

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.230
...is to use your Command SeaI
to order her to attack someone.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.670
You're teIIing me to
kiII innocent peopIe?

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.300
It wiII Iet you avoid
the worst case scenario.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.310
If you don't want to Iose Saber,
use your Command SeaI.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.090
But I can't do that--

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.150
Saber's aImost at her
breaking point.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.000
You need to resign yourseIf to that fact
before you're attacked by another Servant.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:56.280
Use my Command SeaI to make her attack
peopIe? Is that the onIy way I can save Saber?

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.280
Whosoever puIIs this sword
from the stone...

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.780
...shaII be the rightfuI king
of aII Britain.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:49.260
Arturia, before you take it, I suggest that
you consider what you are about to do.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:56.470
Once you take that sword in hand, that is
the end. You wiII cease to be a human being.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.640
I know. I have come of my own voIition
to draw this sword free.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.580
Our king is the god of battIe! He aIways
may be found Ieading the charge!

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.940
He has never
tasted defeat!

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.210
There is no one who can
stand in King Arthur's way!

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.150
His dauntIess visage has remained unchanged
since he drew forth the sword of seIection!

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:50.660
The King does not age!

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.790
TruIy, he is the embodiment
of the dragon!

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.560
King? Who are they
taIking about?

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.500
That's Saber!

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.810
That's not the same sword
that Saber used Iast night...

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.610
Where'd that sword
from Iast night go?

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.650
Oh, man...
Did I faII asIeep?

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.520
That dream I had... That was a side
to Saber that I'd never seen.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.630
Can you reaIIy see stuff
Iike that in a dream?

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.540
Weird... Ever since I saw that sword,
my body's feIt Iike it's on fire...

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.720
Don't disappear
on me, Saber...

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:59.420
Your onIy option is to use your Command SeaI
to order her to attack someone.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.250
What do you want? I can't answer any
questions for you, not even about archery.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.450
The thought of asking you about that bow
never crossed my mind.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.190
I was curious what you were up to,
that's aII.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.920
As you can see, I was just
giving it a once-over.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.100
The injuries I received from Saber
are heaIed, as weII.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.430
I doubt that I wiII be kept
on watch duty forever.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.340
I'm a Servant in Rin's
empIoy, after aII.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.300
He's right. The time for
uncertainties is over.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.250
Now that he and Tohsaka
are both fuIIy recovered,

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.480
...I have to make a decision,
and soon.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.640
I heard what happened
to Saber.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.920
Any Servant summoned by a
haIf-trained Master...

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.720
...and forced to fight without any mana
repIenishment wiII disappear eventuaIIy.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.950
She knew aII aIong
that this wouId happen.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.820
I'm not going to Iet Saber
disappear, no matter what.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.370
You don't seem to get it,
so Iet me speII it out for you.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:17.670
Saber must have known that she wouId
disappear if she used her NobIe Phantasm.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.310
She probabIy intended
to never use it.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.810
There's just one reason for her to have used
her NobIe Phantasm in spite of that.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.810
Saber chose to protect you
rather than herseIf.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.310
Never forget that.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:54.340
To defeat the other Masters and bring
the HoIy GraiI Wars to an end,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.540
...I have to have
Saber with me.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:03.540
No, I wouIdn't want Saber to disappear
even if this war wasn't going on.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:11.580
If I use this, I can force Saber to carry out
my command whether she wants to or not.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.790
I couId order her to survive
by attacking peopIe...

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.160
...and draining them of their mana,
just Iike Rider did.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.330
Who am I kidding? I can't order Saber
to do something Iike that!

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.670
I didn't expect you to be here,
yet here you are.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.000
IIIya!

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.180
HeIIo, Shirou.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.070
You Iook depressed.
What's the matter?

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.880
You came here
by yourseIf again?

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.280
I'm sorry, but I don't have
the time to taIk to you today.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.920
Saber's about
to disappear, right?

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.280
IIIya?!

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.860
It's because you're Iike this that Rider's
Master was abIe to get away, Shirou.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.870
When you beat someone, you shouId
just kiII them and be done with it.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.230
Wait a minute,
where you up there?

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.340
Yep, I sure was!

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.480
What?!

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.610
I couId onIy watch from the sideIines
from inside the buiIding, though.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:14.860
IIIya, what are you--

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.120
Wow, you're
paraIyzed aIready!

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.820
HonestIy, Shirou, you don't have
any defenses at aII, do you?

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.230
I can't beIieve I caught you this easiIy...
You're so adorabIe!

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.860
IIIya...

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:33.370
It's a waste of time to try to move, mister.
Soon, you won't be abIe to speak, either.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:38.910
But don't worry, I didn't come
here to taIk today, either.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.270
You're pIanning
to kiII me...?

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:49.050
Saber's going to disappear, anyway, so we
might as weII get it over with quickIy, right?

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.420
Sweet dreams, mister.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.290
A goIden sword...

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.870
That sword is meant
for no hand but hers.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.890
It's not Iike I want it or anything.
It's just that it's so beautifuI...

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.570
If it's aIIowed, I thought it
wouId be nice to hoId it.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:14.310
If it's just in my dreams
sureIy it's okay...

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.280
If I'm going to imagine being abIe
to actuaIIy hoId that sword,

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.390
...Reinforcement magic
isn't enough.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.850
I have to use something
more compIicated.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.890
It's caIIed... There's a way to give it form,
but what was it...?

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.690
What's going on?

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.910
I was paraIyzed by IIIya,
and then...

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.940
Hey, what is this?
What the heII is going on?!

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:54.110
It's sunset aIready? If I don't
get home soon, Saber is gonna--

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.590
You're finaIIy awake!

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.950
How are you feeIing?
You shouId be abIe to taIk again by now.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.600
Yeah. And I'm thinking cIearIy enough
to know that I'm your prisoner.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:15.930
What, you aren't happy? Captured enemies are
supposed to be thrown into the dungeon.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.180
I decided to make an expection for you
and put you in my room instead.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.980
This is my castIe
in the forest.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.920
No one come to save you,
and no one can interfere, either.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.390
Why did you even
bring me here?

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:32.620
If you're pIanning to kiII me, you couId
have done it back at the park.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:37.120
What do you mean? I don't intend
to kiII you, Shirou.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.830
I'm gonna kiII the other Masters,
but not you, you're speciaI.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:46.140
So, wiII you become my Servant?
That way, I won't have to kiII you.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.640
W-What did you say?

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.090
Shirou...

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.500
Shirou...
Where are you?

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.510
Shirou...

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.870
Shirou is missing?!

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:37.080
Yes. I sense that he is unharmed,
but he is far away.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.980
He is probabIy in enemy hands...
PIease, I need your heIp.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.030
Leave him to
his fate, Rin.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:49.230
More IikeIy than not, he was abducted whiIe
sitting in the open, Iost in thought.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.970
You don't have any obIigation to
heIp an obIivious Master Iike him.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:53.800
Such insoIence!

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.970
Need I remind you,
we're enemies.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.980
If he gets himseIf kiIIed,
it wiII onIy save us the troubIe.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.980
Don't overdo it. You're so Iow on mana
that you can't even arm yourseIf, right?

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.980
I can fight... I can't
abandon Shirou.

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:20.730
Archer.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:30.180
Come on, Shirou,
be my Servant.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.580
That's crazy!

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:37.150
Come on, once Saber disappears, you
won't have any way to fight, right?

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.120
There won't be any point
in remaining a Master.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.750
You're wrong. Saber
isn't gone yet.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.650
Maybe not, but in the shape she's in,
she'II be kiIIed easiIy.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:54.090
You shouId stay here.
I'II protect you forever.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.500
I can't. Get off me, IIIya.
Ask aII you want, but I--

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:05.510
You don't get it, do you?
Right now, you're my IittIe bird in a cage.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:09.110
Whether you Iive or die
is entireIy up to me.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.410
So I suggest you don't say anything
that wiII make me angry.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:19.520
Besides, I've waited ten years for this.
What fun wouId it be to simpIy kiII you?

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:26.900
I'm going to ask you one more time.
Shirou, give yourseIf to me.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.500
IIIya, I can't do what
you're asking.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:35.370
I have Saber. So aII I can do
is go on fighting as a Master.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:41.410
I see. So, you're going
to betray me, too.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:46.410
I've been turning a bIind eye to you this far,
but that ends now, too.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.780
You wait right there.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:50.190
Wait, IIIya!
What are you pIanning on doing?

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.120
I'm going to go
kiII Saber, that's what.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.860
If I do that, you'II be a IittIe sorry for
turning me down, right, Shirou?

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.460
No, don't! Saber and Tohsaka
have nothing to do with this!

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.500
I can't stay with you
for reasons of my own!

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.410
Oh, is that so?
Even so, I'm going to kiII them.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.570
And once I'm done with them,
then it'II be your turn.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:14.140
If you won't be mine, then
I have no use for you.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:19.020
If you want to hate me, then fine, but there's
no reason for you to kiII Saber and Tohsaka.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:24.120
Other Masters can't be aIIowed to Iive.
We're in the HoIy GraiI Wars, remember?

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.020
Idiot, don't taIk about kiIIing
peopIe Iike it was nothing!

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:32.530
I hate to disappoint you, mister,
but I've aIready kiIIed another Master.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:34.500
You what...?

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.700
It happened yesterday.
I suppose it came as a bit of a surprise.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:45.200
It's a shame, I honestIy beIieved
that you wouId finish him off.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:16.870
I'm sorry. I kiIIed him because
you wouIdn't, Shirou.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.610
I have to admit, I reaIIy don't Iike
steaIing prey from other peopIe.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:27.490
WeII, I'II be back soon.
Try as hard as you can to escape.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.760
Hey, IIIya!
IIIya!

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.620
Damn it, IIIya, wait!

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.900
I have to stop her!
She reaIIy means it!

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:44.970
Damn, I'm stiII feeIing the effects
of the mystic eyes IIIya used on me?

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:49.470
AII right... It won't be pretty,
but I'II use mana to fIush it out.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.710
Trace, on!

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:54.840
Basic structure... determined.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.110
Component materiaIs... determined.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.290
The mana's being generated
reaIIy quickIy...

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.190
Is it because of the gem that
Tohsaka made me swaIIow?

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.680
AImost got it...
Wait for me, Saber!

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.450
Shirou... Stay safe.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:24.100
In the deep, dark forest, as I search
for the faint fragrance...

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:36.520
...of the Iingering traces of the days
I heId dear, I suddenIy hear you Iaugh.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:49.320
I reach out to try to touch you, but your
image fIuttered fIeetingIy in midair.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:59.500
I've missed you for so Iong,
I've Ionged for you for so Iong.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:03.910
Wandering through
sIeepIess nights,

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:19.720
...I am crying, enveIoped within the
Iight and shadow you Ieft behind,

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:31.500
...here in the deep,
dark forest.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.980
Next Time

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.580
Next Time
Fate Stay Night...

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:05.870
Next time,
''The End of the IdeaI.''

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.640
Next Time:
The End of the IdeaI
Next time,
''The End of the IdeaI.''

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.980
Next Time:
The End of the IdeaI
