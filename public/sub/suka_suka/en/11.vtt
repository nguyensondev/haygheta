00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.840
You needn't overthink it.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.430
I mean exactly what I say.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.720
We are the special weapons
that you mentioned.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.430
What should we do after breakfast?

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.740
Special weapons.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.600
Mine!

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.790
No, it's mine!

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.400
Sit down and eat.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.530
Hey!

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.460
Attention, girls!

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.630
These girls are special weapons?

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.580
Allow me to introduce you.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.650
This is Second-Grade Technical Officer Willem,
and he'll be living with us from now.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.270
Pleased to meet you all!

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.300
WorldEnd:
What do you do at
the end of the world?
Are you busy?
Will you save us?

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.160
You're up early!

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.550
Up for a duel?

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.360
Not really.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.110
Hup.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.320
Can you reach it now?

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.920
Lakhesh's gonna get eaten!

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.520
Kidnapped!

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.010
No, I'm not!

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.450
I'm not... Right?

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.310
This way!

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.370
Hey.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.660
The children here aren't used
to having adult men around,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.800
so they don't know how to interact with one.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.160
I get that, but I can't deal with
them being terrified every day.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.640
Honestly, it's depressing.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.970
I understand!

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.600
You like little girls,
Technical Officer Willem?

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.090
I do like kids, yes.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.640
Wow, really?

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.820
So which one is your type?

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.410
You have me, the boisterous Ithea,

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.200
capricious li'l Nephren here,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.160
and my recommendation,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.600
the fresh-faced and moody...

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.390
...Chtholly. I know.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.850
Oh? When did you get close?

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.260
You sure move fast.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.680
What's your story?

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.600
Cut it out, Ithea!

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.090
Okay, I will.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.080
I find you three, and all the
little ones, very cute.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.990
What? Lumping me in with the kids?

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.470
You aren't that much older.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.770
I'll have you know I'm a
whole fifteen years old!

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.630
The question is if that falls within
the technical officer's range...

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.690
Ithea!

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.150
Anyway, I wish I could make the
little ones open up to me.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.840
Even when agonized, you look

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.330
ve-ry de-li-cious.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.120
N-Nygglatho?

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.950
Being an adult doesn't mean
you can just do anything—

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.150
I'll get the syrup and caramel ready, then.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.000
Oh, that's what she meant?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.430
I see!

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.680
That's it!

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.470
You can cook, huh?

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.200
A bit, yeah.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.360
A man who can help around
the house is a keeper!

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.150
Yep.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.780
Where did you pick that up?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.110
There.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.860
Here. Tell me what you think.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.950
I-I'll pass.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:08.880
Yeah?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.880
Then...

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.060
Yum.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.090
Looks yummy!

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.440
It smells so good!

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.400
Let's dig in right away, girls!

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.010
Yeah!

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.790
How you've changed.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.200
Before, you seemed more
like an aloof degenerate.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.340
Is something wrong?

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.680
Yeah, I had lost of myself for a moment.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.670
Won't happen again.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.900
I see.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.350
But...

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.460
Seconds!

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.080
We want seconds!

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.740
Willem!

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.230
Willem! Willem!

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.710
I think it's too late now.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.480
Looks like you got them to
open up. Good for you.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.800
Yeah.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.240
Kids really are great. They wear
their hearts on their sleeves.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.780
Agreed.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.120
Thanks for cleaning up with me.
You've been a great help.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.910
Don't mention it.
It's a good distraction.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.170
What? Something on your mind?

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.240
No, nothing.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.720
Cleanup complete!

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.210
Well, goodnight.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.680
Goodnight.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.240
See you tomorrow.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.900
Yeah, see you.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.170
Here I go...

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.620
Take that!

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.260
Lakhesh is dead!

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.060
It's my turn to throw.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.070
No, I'll throw it!

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.530
Hey, stop fighting.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.950
Such a weirdo.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.820
Can't stop thinking about him?

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.560
Wow, nice reaction.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.040
What's wrong with you?!

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.760
Sorry, sorry.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.800
But yeah, the kids took to him instantly.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.380
It's like he's been here for years.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.250
Yes.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.010
The new hat.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.300
You're really cherishing it, putting it
at the back of the closet.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.140
Oh, so that's what that was about.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.640
I-I'm not cherishing it or anything.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.310
It's just that you don't need a hat
like that often, you know?

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.040
Oh?

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.820
What's with the look?

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.030
Well, I'll leave it at that.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.480
Ren, are you interested in him, too?

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.490
Not really.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.320
Though I do find him rather curious.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.990
So you are interested in him.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.180
Chtholly...

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.220
How many days left?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.410
Around ten.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.940
I don't know if that's enough time
to make your romance blossom.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.180
Knock it off, Ithea.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.140
Don't be shy, now.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.340
In this day and age, lots of fairies
never hit adolescence.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.440
But you fell in love, and that
makes you a winner in life!

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.610
It isn't like that...

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.870
I see.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.470
I'll search the study for any
books that might help.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.400
Not you, too.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.420
Don't bother!

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.890
Let's hurry up and get dressed already.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.310
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.520
Tiat's on your team, Collon!

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.130
Jeez...

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.760
I'll get it!

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.820
Wait up!

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.020
Almita!

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.860
Hey...

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.720
You okay, Almita?

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.120
Yeah... Ow...

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:15.620
Hup.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.950
I went and fell.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.900
Don't move. You've got a deep cut.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.290
I'm fine.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.050
Almita!

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.550
Get the ball!

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.960
It's over there!

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.300
Hup.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.390
Hurry up!

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.930
You girls...

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.350
You look like you have something to say.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.520
I didn't realize it until today.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:54.440
They aren't at all concerned
about their lives, huh?

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.530
Yes, they're pretty indifferent.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.150
It isn't normal.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.860
Just who and what are
these girls, anyway?

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.940
Honestly, I'd rather not tell you.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.860
Do you really want to know?

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.880
Once you do, your attitude
toward them will change.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.320
I don't think you'll be able to
treat them the same way.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.830
The past few days, you've acted
like a nice young man.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.810
At first, I found it a bit creepy.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.740
But now, I'm thankful for it.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.850
If possible, I'd like you to keep
things the same for a while longer.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.960
Tell me.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.620
You don't need me to tell you about
the seventeen beasts, right?

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:07.350
The ones created 500 years ago by the
foolish humans... I mean, emnetwihts?

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.690
Awfully self-deprecating, aren't we?

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.800
Around 500 years ago,

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.730
the beasts wiped out all life on the
surface, including emnetwihts.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:21.700
To this day, everyone in these skies
continues to live in fear of them.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.330
How do we fight those beasts?

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.120
The answer lies beyond this door.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.010
Are those... carillons?

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.720
They're called "dug weapons" now.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.760
They're our only means
of fighting the seventeen beasts.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.620
Insania.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.990
Ignareo.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.660
Percival.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.070
Say...

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:07.450
Carillons were special weapons that only
chosen emnetwiht braves could use.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:08.910
Correct.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:14.380
So, with the emnetwihts gone,
who's fighting with them?

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.040
You already know, don't you?

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.510
Tell me.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.720
Those girls are leprechauns.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.620
Fairies who have imitated emnetwihts
since ancient times.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.430
They can use emnetwiht weapons
as an emnetwiht would.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.750
And...

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.730
Their bodies were made as weapons
to be expended in battle,

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.240
and they know no fear of death.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:46.940
You wanted to know what those girls are.
Now you have your answer.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.160
I see.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:54.010
So those girls are your partners now?

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.090
Slow down, Pannibal!

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.850
Wait up!

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.720
By yourself, Nephren?

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.390
Yep.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.600
Where are Chtholly and Ithea?

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.730
Went out.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.530
And they didn't come
back for several days.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.640
Venenum output is inversely proportional
to a spell caster's life force.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.440
The more they want to live,
the lower the output.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.400
And if one who doesn't
care about their life uses it,

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.130
the output rises drastically.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:51.640
All that power will go out
of control immediately,

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.640
causing a massive explosion.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.420
Caster and enemy will be blown up,

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.610
leaving only the dug weapon
on the battlefield.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.540
Yeah,

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.440
those girls are excellent weapons.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.380
If it isn't Technical Officer Willem.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.460
Long time no see.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.260
Are you okay?

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.500
Oh, I'm fine!

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.220
She is, too.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.740
She's just napping 'cause
she's all worn out.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.740
Good.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.700
Fancy running into you here, though.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.980
Out on a walk?

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.560
Nygglatho told me you were coming,
so I'm here to pick you up

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.900
Wait, does that mean...

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.800
You were away fighting the
seventeen beasts, right?

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.460
You knew?

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.120
How embarrassing.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.040
That uniform...

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.000
Are you Willem?

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.750
Yeah. And you are?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.650
Their weapons.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.880
Return them to the vault.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.730
Seniorious and Valgulious, right?

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.150
Wow, I'm amazed you know.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.710
Seniorious is the one Chtholly's
compatible with.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.010
And I've got Valgulious.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.420
You're awfully well-informed.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.600
Did you check our equipment
list or something?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.120
Nope. They just happen to be
swords I'm familiar with.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.590
Oh, really?

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.360
Well, how much do you know?

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.900
Not much.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.290
I know that you're fairies.

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:59.050
And you fight with dug weapons
to protect the world.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.600
That's about it.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.610
Weren't you creeped out by the
idea of weapons that look like us?

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.570
Basically, we're disposable lives.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.780
And we're even using relics of
those wretched emnetwihts.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:16.970
What's up?

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.050
A long time ago,

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.540
I knew someone in a similar situation.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.530
And I owe her a great deal,
for many things.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:27.600
So when I heard your story,

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.750
I couldn't just leave you be.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.180
That's all.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.510
A sudden mention of your past!

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.520
Two people having a
heart-to-heart all alone.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.180
Are you hitting on me right now?

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.810
All alone? Are you forgetting
about the girl on my back?

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.090
Oh!

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.630
It's the start of a love triangle filled
with love, hate, and jealousy!

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.800
Keep it down. You'll wake her.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.430
Yeah, yeah.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.200
What are you doing here?

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.670
Taking care of a patient.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.420
Who are you calling a patient?

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.520
Don't push yourself.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.560
You still have a fever.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.310
I'm your caretaker. Let me
show some concern.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:31.270
I don't need your concern,
caretaker or not...

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.860
I don't have much time left, anyway.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.860
Time? What are you talking about?

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.170
Hey...

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.410
What is it?

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.410
If... And I do mean if...

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.390
If I were going to die in five days,

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.880
would you be a little nicer to me?

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.840
What's that supposed to mean?

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:03.590
In five days, Island 15 will come under
a powerful timere attack.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.310
One of the seventeen beasts?

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:09.590
The beasts cannot fly.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:14.360
But a timere can release
parts of its body into the air

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.100
and make it to the sky islands.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.630
How can you say it'll be five days?

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:20.980
We can predict the attacks.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.760
After centuries of fighting beasts,

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.040
we can do that much, at least.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:33.430
Apparently, the incoming timere
cannot be fought with our usual methods.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.310
But a fairy wielding a dug weapon...

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:40.840
...can take it out at the cost of her life?

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.020
Indeed.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.900
If I use Seniorious to blow myself up,

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.790
I can just barely destroy it.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.810
How lucky is that?

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.370
Nobody else will have to die.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.220
Well?

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.680
There you have it.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.650
Feel like granting me a final request yet?

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:02.760
Depends on what it is.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.910
Well, uh...

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.080
For example, let's see...

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.540
What if I asked you to let me kiss you?

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.960
After all that talk about
having five days left,

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.090
that's what you ask for?

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:34.790
Problem?

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.190
Ouch...

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.490
You're just a kid. Quit trying
to be something you're not.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.850
What the heck?!

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.620
What's wrong with wanting fond
memories before I go?

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.540
I'm about to die, but I
want to leave a mark!

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.680
To remain in someone's heart.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.300
To be connected to someone...

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.980
What's wrong with wishing for that?!

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:05.710
I'm telling you not to sell yourself short.
Don't settle for just anyone.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.270
Buy me while I'm selling myself short!

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.420
It's a basic rule for shopping smart.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:13.850
Go away!

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:17.440
If you won't kiss me, don't touch
me! I'm not crying!

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.820
You sound like you are.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.000
I'm not crying.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:22.840
Jeez...

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.730
Hey, get on your belly for a sec.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:25.800
Can't hear you.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.790
Just do it.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:28.700
I can't hear you!

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:30.910
Oh, come on.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.750
Could you be any more stubborn?

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.300
What just happened?

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:55.310
Er, I didn't really feel that one...

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.840
I knew it.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.200
You're showing typical symptoms
of venenum poisoning.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.120
Due to generating too much,
you've got muscular fever.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.540
Here...

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:15.750
And here?

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.300
O-Ow! That really hurts!

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.130
Once it loosens up, you'll feel better.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.070
That doesn't... really help...

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.320
Just leave it all to me!

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.600
The mightiest brave is here
with the mightiest sword.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.150
There's nothing for you to do.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.500
Yeah, I really can't leave them be.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.920
