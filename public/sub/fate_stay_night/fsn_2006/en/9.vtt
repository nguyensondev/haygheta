00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.730
Why don't you work
with me, Emiya?

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.470
A fourth?!

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.840
You're very kindhearted,
aren't you?

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.170
What's that bag for?

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.680
Will you let me pick out
my own room?

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.110
While we are on the subject of rooms,
l have a request to make, as well.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.050
l believe that l should sleep
in the same room as you.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.850
What are you saying?!

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.320
HEY! What do you mean,
she's ''boarding'' here, Shirou?!

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.590
Shirou, you are naive.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.760
Such sentiment will only get you
killed by the other Masters.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.520
Who are you?

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.020
l am Kojiro Sasaki,
Servant of the Assassin class.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:59.910
My cry doesn't reach the image
of the day l saw in a dream.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:13.220
No matter how l picture my future self, it is
always steeped in hope that will never fade.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:26.200
Reach out your hand and catch
the falling pieces,

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:40.910
...then hold my trembling heart
and leap into the night!

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:52.700
lsn't it enough to live for someone else
and let this moment be all there is?

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:04.680
Let's gently cast aside our false selves
and just be who we really are.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.340
Episode 9:
Elegance in the Moonlight

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.550
You put me in an
awkward position.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.090
Having given me your name, as a knight
l must return the courtesy.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.100
Your name is Kojiro,
you say?

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.200
Hear me, Assassin Servant.
l am--

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.640
That is not necessary.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.180
So, you are an adversary who feels obliged
to give her own name in response.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.410
No, l am the one with
the poor manners.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.190
lt isn't necessary for me
to know your true name.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.320
For those like us, our swords are
all we need to know our opponents.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.320
Has that not always been
the role of Servants?

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.700
Do you not agree,
my good Saber Servant?

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.770
Yes, that is certainly
the case.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.410
As you say.
Then let us fulfill that role, Saber.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.750
What the--?
My chest hurts...

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.280
Saber?

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.220
Saber!

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.430
l don't believe it...
She didn't!

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.860
You are indeed proving
to be difficult.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.130
l would not have expected an
invisible blade to be this troublesome.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.040
My sword style is
a brutal one.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.810
A normal opponent would have
lost his head in one strike.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.640
The fact that you have held out for
this long... fills my heart with joy, Saber.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.320
What is the matter?
This can't be all that you have.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.660
Surely your invisible blade
isn't merely an empty gimmick.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.730
Cease your
incessant babbling!

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.700
l am done measuring
your blade.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.630
l'd say that it is roughly 3 feet in length,
and about 4 inches in width.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.620
l can't believe
that girl!

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.150
You used no magic of any sort,
and we have not fought for very long,

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.620
...yet you were able
to measure my sword?

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.290
l would say that it
is time, Saber.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.360
Come now, stop hiding the true
extent of your abilities.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.870
Are you suggesting that l have
been holding back against you?

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.370
Are you suggesting
that you haven't?

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.580
l don't know what you
are playing at,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.870
...but it is insulting to be attacked
by a sword that is still sheathed.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.020
lf that is your wish.
l will put an end to this, then.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.790
lf you are reluctant
to employ your own,

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.580
...allow me to demonstrate my own
secret sword technique first.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.290
Raise your sword.
Otherwise, you will die, Saber.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.020
Secret technique...

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.560
...Turning Swallow Strike!

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.500
Oh, you blocked it...

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.250
Your Master is
most clever.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.720
Using his Saber as a diversion while
you sneak into my encampment...

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.230
Say what you will.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.560
l am merely acting in accordance
with my Master's plans.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.430
One of the three Knight-class Servants
would be another matter,

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.430
...but l am more than a match
for a Rider.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.840
Crap!

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:35.030
A swallow senses disturbances in the air
and changes the path of its flight.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.020
ln which case, one must simply
close off all avenues of escape.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:45.200
The first strike attacks the swallow. The second
strike hems in the swallow as it dodges.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.000
However, swallows are
nimble creatures.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:55.140
To succeed, the strikes must be made in
the same breath, almost simultaneously.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.540
The technique you employed just now
was not that simple.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.980
When you struck, your sword was
genuinely in two places at once.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.330
A multidimensional
refraction phenomenon...

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.870
You used no
magic whatsoever.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.570
Through swordsmanship alone, you achieved
something on par with a Noble Phantasm...

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.200
Unfortunately, my footing
was bad.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.900
The key to the Turning Swallow Strike
is found in the third blow.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:27.140
lf the steps here were slightly wider, l would
have been able to land a horizontal strike.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.120
l had cursed my fate of being
summoned into this material world.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.660
But tonight, that is
at an end.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.890
The sword match that l never had
while l was alive...

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:51.070
lf l can have a fight resulting in our deaths in which
l can utilize my every technique to its fullest,

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.400
...then being summoned
was well worth it.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:13.060
l see. You are definitely not an adversary
that l can hold back against.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:23.660
Oh, your head is finally
in the game, Saber?

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.190
Let's see you how fare against my
own attack, Assassin Servant!

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:20.850
That light--

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.730
Saber!

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.680
These winds are on par
with a typhoon, l'd say

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.080
But there has to be
more to it than this.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:47.320
Come, show me what is within
that light, Saber!

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:53.820
Saber... !

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.090
What's with this wind?!
Can l even get any closer?

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.770
ls this... ls this Saber's mana?

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:10.840
But she isn't fully healed yet!
This is crazy!

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.450
Saber!

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.790
Who's there?!

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:49.880
Delay your strike, Saber.
Someone is spying on your sword technique.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.850
lf we continue, this will no longer
be a contest between you and me.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.750
Wait!

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.160
You intend to leave this fight
unfinished, Assassin?

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.520
l will finish our game if you
cross this temple gate.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.230
Unfortunately, my orders
only extend that far.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:11.860
Besides, it was a lucky break for you
that our match was interrupted, wasn't it?

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.140
Look, someone has come
for you.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:23.250
l suggest that you leave before our uninvited
spectator turns his attention to the boy.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.850
Saber! Damn it, Saber!

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.050
Wha--?

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:46.700
Saber!

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:33.450
Seeing her asleep like this makes me forget
that l was going to chew her out...

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.350
Oh, so this is where you
like to have your fun?

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.560
My, what an
interesting hobby.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.860
Tohsaka!

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.800
Oh, don't mind me.
Go right ahead.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.390
No! lt's not what you think!
You have it totally wrong!

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.740
l was taking Saber to her room!
No, carrying her!

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.810
You see that,
don't you?!

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.810
Oh, sure.
More or less.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.810
You big, fat liar!
Your tone of voice says otherwise.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:07.810
Saber went off by herself to fight,
and you went to stop her, right?

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.510
Uh... Yeah.

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.890
l'll carry her to her room,
so you go make us some tea.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.390
Some tea?

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:20.100
l'm kinda interested in hearing
what happened to you two.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.900
Oh, and l brought my tea set with me.
lt's in the back of the cupboard to the right.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.270
Yes, ma'am...

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.270
ls this about right?

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.320
Shirou, do you mind?

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.350
Sure, l'll be right there.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.790
Thanks, that'll be all.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.620
What're she doing up?
l thought she was sleeping.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.730
She came to just now. Her body temporarily
shut itself down, that's all.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.090
lt wasn't a
long-lasting sleep.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.270
Oh, really?

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.100
Saber, why did you
do that?

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.740
l went to Ryudou Temple and
fought an Assassin Servant.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:17.050
We sensed the presence of a third
Servant and called off the fight, but...

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.620
No, what l was asking was, why did you
go and fight in the first place?

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.630
Servants fight,
it's what we do.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.630
As my Master, why do you
tell me NOT to fight?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.940
Um, l...
That's because l--

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.980
Do you believe that doing so will allow
you to survive the Holy Grail Wars?

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.410
No, l just--

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:46.820
Look, l just don't want a girl to get hurt!
As a man, l can't let that happen.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.050
l am a warrior! Do you take me
for some frail woman?!

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.750
l insist that you take back
what you said just now!

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.590
Look, l realize that you might
be really tough, but...

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.530
Don't get hung up over stupid
little details, you idiot!

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.520
l should say that it is YOU who are
obsessed with trivial details.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:08.970
ln any case, l'd sooner go into battle myself
than make you fight!

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.570
You would provide me with as much protection
as a sheet of paper, Shirou.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.310
That was a little harsh,
Saber...

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.110
You underestimate
the power of Servants.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:22.480
You must think highly of yourself to think that
a human being could defeat an Epic Hero!

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:29.690
You misunderstand him, Saber.
He isn't underestimating Servants.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:36.000
lt's a simple matter of him not
wanting to see you get hurt.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.240
Right?

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.170
T-That's not true at all!
l don't care about--

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:44.040
You know that you can't beat
a Servant yourself, right?

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:51.010
He doesn't want you to get hurt, Saber.
So he'll fight, even though it's crazy.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.280
He knows that he won't win,
but he tries to win all the same.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.190
He doesn't care that
he might die as a result.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.760
He values the lives of others
more than his own.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.540
Shirou.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.080
Now what?

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.550
l will allow you
to fight.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.980
However, if it is what you want,
l have a suggestion.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.150
Get to the point, okay?

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.010
Take up sword training.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.350
Whenever your schedule permits it,
l will train you in the use of a sword.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.520
lf you agree to my suggestion,
l will agree to yours.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:42.190
You mean... Am l going to be doing
the fighting from now on?

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.430
Forget about it!

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.400
Teaching Shirou how to use
a sword doesn't mean...

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.700
...that he'll have a hope in hell
against a Servant!

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.040
But it's better than knowing
nothing at all.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:54.550
At the very least, it will teach him
how to keep his cool during battle.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:58.050
Anything beyond that will depend on
how determined you are.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.740
Yeah! l'm ready anytime
you are, lady!

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.550
Now look here, you idiot! You're not exactly in
a position to take some leisurely sword classes!

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.960
l know that.
We are in a battle.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.890
But l insist that Shirou
becomes used to battle,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.460
...and experience for himself what ''death as
a result of battle'' truly entails, not just once,

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.400
...but as often
as time allows.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.540
l will turn in.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.740
You should get
some rest, too, Shirou.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.050
Tomorrow morning, l am going to make
you sweat buckets in the dojo.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.410
Good night.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.380
Hey, Saber--

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.790
Now you've
made her serious.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.600
ls she angry at me?
Or is she--

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.630
Beats me. But now that that's settled,
feel free to go die your hero's death.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.120
l'll sit by your deathbed.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.230
Gee, you're too kind.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:05.220
l'd sooner go into battle myself
than make you fight!

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:24.330
ln the deep, dark forest, as l search
for the faint fragrance...

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:36.750
...of the lingering traces of the days
l held dear, l suddenly hear you laugh.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:49.550
l reach out to try to touch you, but your
image fluttered fleetingly in midair.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:59.730
l've missed you for so long,
l've longed for you for so long.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.140
Wandering through
sleepless nights,

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:19.960
... l am crying, enveloped within the
light and shadow you left behind,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:31.740
...here in the deep,
dark forest.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.280
Next Time

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.880
Next Time
Fate Stay Night...

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.170
Next time,
''The Calm lnterlude.''

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.910
Next Time:
The Calm lnterlude
Next time,
''The Calm lnterlude.''

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.140
Next Time:
The Calm lnterlude
