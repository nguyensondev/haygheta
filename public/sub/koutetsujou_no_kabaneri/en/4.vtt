00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.650
Why did you... kill her?

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.050
She was pregnant...

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.650
Murderer!

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.250
The child was tainted as well.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.900
There was no saving it.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.350
How can you...?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.800
Oh, my God.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.810
Ikoma!

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.800
You are...!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.100
Bastard!

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.850
What is the meaning of this?!

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.960
Was I... trying to bite her?!

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.620
No way... am I turning into a Kabane?!

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.600
You can drop the act, monster!

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.300
Corpse wench!

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.550
Corpseless.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.100
Anyway, launch the Iron Fortress.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.200
The Corpses are here.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.800
What?

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.550
Stop pushing!

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.400
Hurry, the Corpses are coming!

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.850
We're not done with the repairs!

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.350
They can't wait for us to be done!

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.450
We have to get out of here first!

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.100
Stay back!

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.900
Are you sure you don't want me to fight?

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.600
I'm sorry...

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.300
...but some are afraid of
getting bitten from behind.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.950
Are you human or a Corpse?!

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.650
I'm neither!

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.600
I'm a Corpseless!

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.380
I will remember that day

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.800
Losing myself

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.140
In steam

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.530
Countless mistakes are made

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.820
When I can't see anything ahead

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.580
You said

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.120
"Ask your own burning blood"

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.000
Answer my beat

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.090
Corpseless of the Iron Fortress

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.970
Stand up

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.350
And slam everything onto the ground

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.690
My soul is devoted to my friend

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.440
Burn your life

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.450
Change the world

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.940
Chapter
Four

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.940
Flowing
Blood

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.750
There's no mistake.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.500
The Corpseless brought the Corpses here.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.350
The damned jinxes.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.510
I don't want the Corpseless here.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.200
We should be throwing them off the train!

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.400
This has all failed so miserably.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.300
That's not true.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.700
Don't worry, there are no bite marks.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.950
Thank you.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.100
I wish I could have a sweet bun...

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.050
Is Ayame-sama here?!

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.950
I do not see her.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.200
I shall be there shortly!

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.400
What now?

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.200
Be strong.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.050
How are you going to take responsibility
for this unmitigated disaster?

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.100
This is what happens when
you trust the Corpseless!

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.560
Watch your tongue!

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.500
You are addressing the Yomokawa heir!

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.100
The people are uneasy.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.750
They feel it may be too dangerous
to leave the Iron Fortress in your hands.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.650
You bastard!

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.000
Indeed...

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.950
...it may be true that I am lacking.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.400
Ayame-sama.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.850
So you will admit to it.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.100
Then please hand over the master key.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.850
We will be taking control
of the Iron Fortress now.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.700
Engineer!

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.150
Change course for the mountains.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.850
The mountains are dangerous!

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.020
It's surrounded by high ground,
and more vulnerable to Corpses attacks!

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.850
It's the faster way to Diamond Citadel.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.560
So much for "Corpseless"...

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.300
In the end I'm just a Corpse!

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.900
You're hungry, aren't you?

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.100
I'm starving too.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.800
Stop!

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.100
Takumi!

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.300
We don’t want any Corpseless lovers!

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.850
Did you forget you got saved
by these Corpselesss?

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.750
Why me too?

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.150
Hurry up and get inside now!

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.200
You've got to be kidding me.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.100
Stay back, Takumi!

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.650
I might be a Corpse!

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.150
Seems like it.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.850
I heard you attacked Ayame-sama.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.650
You dog.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.550
I...

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.400
Pervert.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.400
Why?!

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.300
Here, I brought you this.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.200
You're not going to let them
order you around, are you?

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:14.900
Takumi...

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.400
This is perfect.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.950
We were just getting hungry.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.050
Right, Ikoma?

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.850
Huh?

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.050
Hey!

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.050
Maybe I'll ask you.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.350
Stop it!

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.550
I'm trying to give people the choice.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.600
What was that?

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.000
It's from outside.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.750
They're going to disconnect our car!

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.600
Hey, there's people here!

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.000
Shut up, traitor!

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.500
Anybody who sides with
the Corpses aren't human!

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.200
They're all cowards.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.400
Just as brother said.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.650
Stop!

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.250
What was that?

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.450
It can't be!

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.550
Corpses!

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.550
It's the Corpses!

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:54.850
Oh, my God!

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.200
Open this door!

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.100
It's a Bizarro.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.800
What?

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.500
It's learned how to fight from experience

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.100
They're formidable.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:29.950
Move.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.450
Damn it, this won't work.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.750
It's the Corpses!

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.050
Save us!

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.100
Help--

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.600
It's the Corpses!

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.840
Corpses are inside!

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.450
Co--

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.600
The seventh car and back
have been taken over!

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.700
The Corpses have invaded the train cars?!

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.700
Isn't there some way to disconnect
the cars without the master key?

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.150
You're not going to save them?!

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.250
Sometimes it's necessary to
simply minimize casualties!

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:17.900
Leave it to me.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:20.650
We will take care of this.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.800
No, I will go as well.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.250
We are heading to the rear cars.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.400
I ask those who are able to follow me!

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.150
Send everyone without weapons to the front!

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.550
We need to stop the Corpses!

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.000
Let's go, Nameless.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.900
We'll exit from the service
hatch and go after it.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.770
You want to go outside?

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:54.900
It's our only option.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.300
We are... stopping the Bizarro ourselves!

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.650
Fire!

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.310
Kurusu, go get your sword!

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.350
What?

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.800
You saw how the Corpseless fought.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.750
Close combat is possible.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.650
As long as you're a trained Knight!

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.300
Hold your position!

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.750
Well, I said that...

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.750
...but this isn't going to be easy.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:55.550
Damn it.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.750
We'll go as soon as we clear the tunnel!

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.550
You wouldn't do that.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.200
We'll be passing in and out of tunnels for a while.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.660
Unless you actually want to get your head lopped off.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.200
I can't quit now!

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.200
If I could at least know when we'd clear a tunnel.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.900
The entrance said Yodose Cavern, didn't it?

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.500
You could read that?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.050
At this speed?

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.400
Then maybe we're lucky.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.900
There'll be a break in
tunnels after three more.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:27.900
That'll be when we strike.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.050
Kuranosuke!

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.250
Ayame-sama.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.800
I am a Warrior as well!

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.300
No way...

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.150
There's no end.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.250
Ayame-sama, please stay back.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:19.800
Kurusu...

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.650
We'll be able to go after this one!

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.450
We take out the Corpses on top
before we reach the next tunnel...

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.050
...and then jump into the car in front of us?

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:35.900
That’s right!

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:37.450
Ikoma.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:41.550
I might be... coming to my limit
sooner than I thought.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.250
If that's the case, you'll be on your own.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:45.600
Can you do it?

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.300
What other choice do I have?!

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.800
I figured you'd say that.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.550
Nameless-chan!

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:55.900
I'm sorry.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.700
Um...

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.950
I know they may have said
some awful things to you...

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.050
...but... please save them!

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.850
Hey, I need someone around to keep
this Iron Fortress moving, after all.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.150
We're through!

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.000
Let's go.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.400
Don't order me around.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.850
Ikoma!

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.750
You can do it!

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:12.350
We're almost there!

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.800
You're way slower than Nameless!

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.950
What are you spacing out for?!

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.150
All right, we've cleared the top.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.250
Nameless?

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:07.750
Kurusu!

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.900
Who... is this?!

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.300
The Corpse knows sword fighting?!

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:48.750
Kurusu!

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:50.200
Back me up!

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.200
Kurusu, hang in there!

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.650
Hurry, he needs to be treated!

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.550
Ikoma...

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.100
You have to take down the Bizarro.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.200
Okay.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.050
Don't get thrown off.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:08.950
I'm counting on you.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:13.150
If you're a dead meat... by the time I wake up...

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.000
...that would really... inconvenience me.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.800
Ikoma!

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.100
What's wrong?

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.100
Are you okay?

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.800
She's only sleeping!

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.150
Take care of her!

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.050
Okay!

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:37.950
Me too...?

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:46.450
Jiro!

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.500
I will... save them!

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.860
More! Send more shields!

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.800
Purification!

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.360
I will... protect them!

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.700
I will... defeat him!

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.550
I don't care who...

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.350
...somebody just give me blood!

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.100
And I'll take him down!

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.950
Corpseless?

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:29.800
I see.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.450
If we had his gun...

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.350
...we could tear through its heart cage.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.690
You saw it pierce through
the Corpse's heart, didn't you?

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.650
A-Ayame-sama!

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.550
Ikoma!

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.600
This is a contract!

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.000
In exchange for my blood...

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.000
...you will fight for us, Ikoma!

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.000
You're not getting past!

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.500
Hurry up!

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.000
Your motions are too big.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.600
You've got a lot to learn!

00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:59.700
Ikoma did it!

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.500
Purification!

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.050
Purification!

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.150
Victory!

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.900
Purification! Purification!

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:35.600
Purification! Purification! Purification! Purification!

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.550
Damn it.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.700
We will have the two Corpselesss
ride with us on the Iron Fortress.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.450
But... the Corpselesss crave blood.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.050
What are you going to—?

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.450
I shall offer them my own blood.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:16.900
I am opposed to this.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.700
You will not be able to provide enough
blood to the two of them on your own.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.700
She won't be alone.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.300
Please use my blood as well.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:29.550
You won't mind if the blood
comes from a guy, right?

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.950
It's true that they are good to have on our side.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.150
Thank you, everyone.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.950
Perhaps the souls of those we couldn't save...

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.400
...will eventually... find their way to my sister.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.200
If they do...

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.850
...could they relay a message for me?

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.300
That I promise to live for her too.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.500
And even if she feels a little lonely...

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.600
...just wait there for me for a little while longer.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:29.540
Fitting in with the crowd

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:34.910
﻿Like a puzzle piece

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:40.590
﻿Is a lie without a shadow

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:46.260
﻿Forgotten glory

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:51.260
﻿Irritation is filled

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:56.590
﻿In a box

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:02.140
﻿Waiting to start

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.640
﻿Delusional goal

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.060
﻿Don't be above your daydream

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.190
﻿Smooth vision

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:18.710
﻿If your dream loses its way

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:24.280
﻿I will sing
﻿I will build a bridge

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:30.880
﻿To sound the silence

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:39.190
﻿Rhythm continues, forever to stay on one side

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:44.730
﻿Passed townscape goes far away with ending love

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:50.030
﻿To undelivered torn image

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:56.480
﻿Resistance is awakened
﻿Disqualified impulse
