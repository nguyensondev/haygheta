00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.000
Go for it!

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.340
Hang in there!

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.230
You can do it!

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.820
It's so cold...

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.120
Where did this come from?

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.060
Chtholly, are you awake?

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.270
WorldEnd:
What do you do at the end of the world?
Are you busy?
Will you save us?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.040
Man, I'm bored! Bored, bored, bored!

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.470
Surface Survey Ship, Saxifraga

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.280
So bored!

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.940
Quiet, Nopht.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.730
Rhan, I know you're actually bored, too.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.450
What is that? An ancient book?

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.270
One of our finds from yesterday.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.240
You can read emnetwiht writing?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.330
I can connect the dots between words
and guess at what they say.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.090
And... well?

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.670
What does it say?

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.190
"The human race should have
never come into being.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.320
The visitors were the ones
who created them.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.230
It was the gods' first mistake,

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.400
and it was the biggest."

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.170
What the heck?

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.780
That is my best guess at
what this book is saying.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.060
"Beasts... by humans...
truth... leash..."

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.780
Oh, this might be vice versa.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.710
"Humans unleash the beasts, and fill
the world with the ashen truth."

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.750
Whoa!

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.800
Get off me, Nopht.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.320
It's talking about the beasts
destroying the surface, right?

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.880
Wow. It's a prophecy.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.840
No.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.820
This seems to be a fairytale
or a textbook of sorts.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.440
More likely, humans created the beasts
in accordance with this text.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.440
That would be the natural assumption.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.150
I see.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.210
However, this almost
makes it seem like...

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.290
Who is it?

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.630
Is this the waiting room
for the fleet escort?

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.090
I'm a salvager with your fellow passengers,
the Orlandry Merchant Guild.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.660
The name's Grick!

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.180
Pleased to meet ya.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.490
Chtholly!

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.880
It's you! You aren't a ghost!

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.110
Tiat...

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.320
Hey, she hasn't fully recovered yet.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.460
Forgive her.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.950
She seemed out of sorts
the entire time you were broken.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.070
Yeah.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.950
For some reason, I just felt so down...

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.380
I see.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.920
I see you've grown up, too.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.270
Hey, Chtholly!

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.130
Are you all better now?

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.760
Morning.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.840
Feeling all right?

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.460
Yeah, morning...

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.890
Are you going out now?
You're wearing your hat.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.880
Oh, no. I just have horrible bed-head today.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.740
Anyway, how was morning practice?

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.480
Piece of cake!

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.330
Now I'm hungry...

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.050
Same.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.450
I'm starving.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.790
Pipe down, girls.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.890
You can have breakfast after you
wash your hands and face.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.130
Yes, ma'am!

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.130
Shall we get going, then?

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.920
Aren't you two eating?

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.090
I'd like to give her a
checkup first, just in case.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.260
Oh...

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.830
See you.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.860
The survey unit's adviser, you say?

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.110
Yeah.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:52.200
I figured I should come say hello to
the ones who'll hold my life in their hands!

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.680
That's a funny thing to say.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.290
Do we really look like
beast-fighting escorts to you?

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.940
Frankly, I still don't fully believe it.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.380
Really, I'd very much
like to laugh it off...

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.380
But the thing is

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.000
you're girls with dug weapons.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.680
It matches what I've heard too perfectly.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.640
What's the word? "Leprechauns"?

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.100
You know that much?

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.960
A couple of friends happen
to be in the know.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.100
Anyway, here's a token of friendship!

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.160
You haven't been home in more than a month.
You probably miss good food.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.490
I bought these on Island 31 on my way here.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.790
They're meat pies!

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.600
A-Are you kidding me?

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.910
You can't curry favor with us using such—

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.370
We'll gladly take them.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.880
Hey, Rhan!

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.660
As it turns out, we have
nothing in particular to do.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.720
We could join him for a chat, don't you think?

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.940
Well, if you say so...

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.520
"Grick," was it?

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.750
Yeah.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.800
Have you been a salvager long?

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.740
Somewhat, yeah.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.860
Have you ever run into a beast?

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:18.300
Huh? You want to ask me
something about beasts?

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.870
Yes.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.510
What in the world are
the beasts, anyway?

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.770
Where were they born? And how?

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.780
And why did they wipe out
the emnetwihts on the surface?

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.800
You seem to care an awful lot about that.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.010
While they may threaten your existence,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.970
they are the very reason for ours.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:12.270
I would learn a lot more if I could
just bite off some of your flesh.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.530
Yeah, please don't.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.270
So...

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.650
Is there anything wrong with my body?

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.240
I wouldn't say "wrong."

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.570
I wouldn't say that, but...

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.110
Thanks for coming shopping with me.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.400
You're even carrying the stuff back.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.460
I had an errand to run anyway,
so don't mention it.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.420
You've been working at that bakery
for a while, right?

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.430
I'm surprised they let you.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:09:01.430
The military brass didn't like the idea,
but Nygglatho convinced them.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.730
What do you think?

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:09.820
How do you feel about us weapons
working for money like anyone else?

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.530
Grown-ups are supposed to ensure
that kids can do what they want.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.240
As long as it's not anything wrong,
I won't have a problem with it.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.540
Um, I love you, Willem!

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.670
I don't know what having a father
is like, but this sure feels like it.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.510
I already consider you
my kids, more or less.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.100
Really?

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.900
Wait, who would that make the mother?

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.810
Nygglatho?

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.730
But Chtholly's...

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.800
Come on, get going.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.610
I have to start cooking.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.790
The silver test came up negative.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.030
And what does that mean?

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:04.700
Silver powder reacts to irregular death.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.050
Simply put, it's a drug
that's used to detect spirits.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.060
And leprechauns are a type of spirit,

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.920
so your blood should have turned black
when mixed with the silver reagent.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.140
But there was no reaction at all.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.980
I don't know the reason, but right now,

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.890
your body is not a leprechaun's.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.140
Wait!

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.900
What are you talking about?

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.070
What's happened to my body?

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.610
I have no idea.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.070
This is simply the natural conclusion
based on the findings.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.660
Are these strands a result of that, too?

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.450
A side effect of your coma, perhaps?

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.480
What's going to happen to me?

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.720
You really don't feel anything
wrong with your body?

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.170
N-No, I feel perfectly normal.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.240
Then don't worry about it now.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.770
Leave it to me. I'll look into it some more.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.020
Okay.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.740
Don't get any weird ideas
about dyeing your hair.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.360
I don't think it'd bother Willem.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.820
Wh-What are you talking about?

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.080
But until everything is cleared up,

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.580
stay away from your dug weapon.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.540
No telling what might happen.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.300
But then...

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.930
What good is a fairy soldier
who can't wield a sword?

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.430
Want to prepare to get married, then?

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.680
Seriously, Willem's contract
will eventually expire.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.270
Of course, knowing him,

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.680
I'm sure he would stay if we all asked.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.490
Why not just do that, then?

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.280
Non, non! That wouldn't
be persuasive enough!

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:09.420
We need to drill it into his head
that this is his home!

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.400
R-Right...

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.630
The best way to do that is for him
to have a wife and family.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.720
Huh?! Is that how it works?

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.340
That is how it works.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:26.030
Honestly, I was thinking
of volunteering myself—

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.050
Don't!

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.770
I... wouldn't stand a chance.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:40.570
Then become a fine lady
and hook that man already.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.200
Waste too much time,

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.030
and I or another girl will
beat you to the punch.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.750
Looks yum!

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.410
Time to dig in!

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.420
So good!

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.210
Wow, this is heaven!

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.630
You're too well prepared, TO.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.230
What do you mean?

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:10.270
If you only baked cake for her,
you figured she'd hold back, right?

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.040
I'm impressed you baked
enough for all of us.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.140
Now, that's what you call a plan.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.160
Hey, Ren. Where's Chtholly?

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.300
Probably in her room.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.570
Did something happen?

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.490
She doesn't eat sweets
in front of others.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.990
Talk about putting on airs!

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.000
Well, it isn't much of an issue.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.680
You can take it to her room yourself

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.460
and spend some sugary-sweet
time together.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.150
Don't make it sound dirty.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.190
Er, you know...

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:50.350
I don't want to seem childish
in front of the other girls.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.850
And, uh, from what I've heard...

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.900
When I eat stuff like that,
I really let myself go.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.150
As the eldest, I have a reputation to uphold.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.360
What's with the look?

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.000
It's just that making a big deal
out of the most pointless thing

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.920
shows that you're still a kid.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.030
Say what?

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.140
Shall I also get you some tea, my lady?

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.340
Such a nice, sweet aroma.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.340
Right?

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.630
Seems delicious.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.430
It actually is.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:35.560
Can I really eat this?

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:37.810
Do you even need to ask?

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.040
Who do you think I baked it for?

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:04.900
I did it...

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.360
I... I kept my promise.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.940
Must've been rough, huh?

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.180
Yeah... Yeah!

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.730
It really, really was!

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.690
I know I said this yesterday.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.070
But welcome home, Chtholly.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.270
I'm home...

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.750
I finally got to say it.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.850
Yeah. And I finally got to hear it.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:53.090
Does the red hair look weird?

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.200
It's a very pretty color.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.770
Looks great.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.350
Huh? Oh.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.190
Hmm...

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.410
O-Okay, I'm good!

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:12.010
Really? You aren't under the weather
or anything, right?

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.820
I'll be mad if you push yourself.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:14.800
I'm fine!

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.950
And I have cooking, laundry,
and lots of other stuff to do!

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.040
Don't get too worked up.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:20.910
I won't.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:23.540
Just wait, and you'd best be ready!

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.390
Hey!

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.840
What happened to wiping your
shoes before you come inside?

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.640
We're sorry.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.100
If I'm really freed from
being a fairy soldier,

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:50.440
and I'm allowed to pursue the
same dreams as everyone else,

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:51.820
then...

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.490
I want to live, standing
shoulder-to-shoulder with him.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.860
I want to see the same things,
walk down the same path,

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:06.390
eat the same food, and take in
the same sights as he does.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.720
If I could spend my life
that way, with him...

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:25.140
Getting better at housework is
all well and good, but it's like...

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.560
She only does stuff for Willem?

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.410
Making yet another spicy meat dish?

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:45.280
And this one's tailored to a certain
someone's taste buds, too...

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.810
O-Oh, shut up!

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:50.170
Only the one on cooking duty
is allowed in the kitchen!

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.530
It's a very pretty color.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.700
Looks great.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:55.380
Yep.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.500
When did you hear that?!

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.100
It's amazing how girls in love
are so full of life!

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:08.020
But I don't know about hogging the kitchen
just to get through to one guy's stomach.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.120
How is said fairy soldier?

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.690
It's been around five days since she awoke,
and so far, she seems fine.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.600
I see. That's great news.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.410
Uh...

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.220
What's with your getup?

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:30.630
I'm currently under suspension
for leading a losing battle.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.200
I cannot wear my uniform.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:34.420
Huh...

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:40.090
So, why are we here? We even made
the off-duty lizard come all this way.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.260
To discuss Chtholly's immediate future.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:48.020
I thought we three should talk about it.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.700
Those girls are weapons. They cannot
retire or be discharged from duty.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.620
So, although Chtholly is
not a leprechaun now,

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.070
she is still a fairy soldier on paper.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.450
And she can't turn down
an order to sortie, huh?

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.290
Could you adjust the sortie lineup
on your end, First Officer?

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.290
I could, but the order might
come from a higher-up.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.840
Say, doesn't the Great Sage have
some influence with the military?

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.150
That man is the military's top adviser.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.560
Then make sure he receives a
report that goes like this:

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.340
"In order to research leprechaun physiology,

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:36.860
TO Kmetsch has chosen fairy soldier
Chtholly Nota Seniorious as a test subject."

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.530
What is that about?

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.130
If I indirectly ask to be given
responsibility for Chtholly,

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:47.120
he'll probably agree to it,
figuring he can make me owe him one.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.870
What kind of relationship do you think
you and the Great Sage have?

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.680
The bigger issue is how to replace Chtholly.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.630
Ithea and Nephren can't handle
the load by themselves.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.840
Oh, about that...

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:08.330
I heard from the guild that beasts
attacked the surface survey team.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.520
And that the Saxifraga was sunk.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:11.980
Saxi...

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.920
And what of the warriors aboard?

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.300
Both are a bit worn out,
but apparently unhurt.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.360
Hang on a second, you two.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.450
Survey team? Both?

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:27.660
Oh, right. You only arrived a month ago.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.740
Do you know how many battle-ready
fairies we currently have?

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.710
Other than Chtholly, three.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.000
Including Tiat, who hasn't
been paired with a sword.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.480
The answer is five.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.470
Ithea, Nephren, Tiat. And then,
we have Nopht and Rhantolk.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.840
And where are they right now?

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.560
Surely you can put two
and two together.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.450
For real?

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:53.810
For real.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.490
What's that?

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.700
B-Beast!

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:30.760
You moron!

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.210
That thing reacts to sound and motion.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:34.890
Shut up and sit tight.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.860
Oh, come on...
What's wrong with them?

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.330
Okay, this is bad news.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:21.020
I expected a beast to put up a better fight.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.980
Insane...

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.130
Do you mean the beast?

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.800
Or perhaps...

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.010
Next Episode

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.010
slight light, slight hope

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.000
Next Episode:

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.980
slight light,
slight hope.
