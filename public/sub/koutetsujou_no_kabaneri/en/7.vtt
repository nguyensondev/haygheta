00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.000
Oh, this is fun, isn't it?

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.830
Now try that "kapow-kapow."

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:18.850
What?

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm not sure if I remember it.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.900
When did you learn Kurusu's move?

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.000
The Corpseless are good at copying others.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200
How does it feel seeing his
swordsmanship be as good as yours?

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.900
What was that for?!

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.700
Do not flatter yourself
for copying one move.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.550
Wow, that was so childish.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.290
You're pretty closed minded, aren't you?

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.260
What?!

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.950
Ikoma, you steal that move too...

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.900
...and then use it right back on him!

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.250
Got it.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.000
What?!

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.500
I see the station!

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.300
It's Shitori Station.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.800
What's going to happen this time?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.150
There are people!

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.530
Finally! A station with people in it!

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.750
Heeeey!

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.700
We can rest easy for a bit now.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.800
Yeah.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.900
Are you human or a Corpse?!

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.500
I'm neither!

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.500
I'm a Corpseless!

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.400
I will remember that day

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.400
Losing myself

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.700
In steam

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.550
Countless mistakes are made

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.950
When I can't see anything ahead

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.750
You said

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.250
"Ask your own burning blood"

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.500
Answer my beat

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.050
Corpseless of the Iron Fortress

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.000
Stand up

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.500
And slam everything onto the ground

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.750
My soul is devoted to my friend

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.450
Burn your life

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.500
Change the world

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.000
Chapter
Seven

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.000
Begging
the Heavens

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.400
We meet with the lord of the station.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.250
I leave the Iron Fortress in your hands.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.950
You can count on us.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.000
You must attend to your duties.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.350
Ayame-sama, we are out of daita-iron.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.850
Daita-iron?

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.950
Material used for the jet bullets.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.750
Its low evaporation point increases
the piercing capabilities.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.130
Then could I ask you to get more?

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.750
Yes!

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.600
We need spare parts to repair
the Iron Fortress as well.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.150
You're right.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.400
Clothes and medicine would be nice too.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.500
We have been asked to leave by the 8th.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.900
Isn't the 8th is tomorrow?!

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.500
Then today is Tanabata, huh?

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.790
We've got better things to do
than hang our wishes on bamboo.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.850
What is he talking about?

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.000
You don't know about Tanabata?

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.820
You write your wish on a card
and hang it from a bamboo tree.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.150
I want to do that!

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.450
I'm not sure we have the time to.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.200
We don't even know if we have
enough money to buy supplies.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.750
Let's celebrate Tanabata.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.450
Please use this for money.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.050
Ayame-sama, that's...!

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.910
Can I ask you to handle it?

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:21.550
Yes!

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.850
Ready and...!

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.570
Did you hear?

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.900
It's Tanabata today!

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.400
I completely forgot!

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.450
The shopping team is
going to bring back bamboo.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.650
Then we'd better write down our wishes.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.500
Oh, the bamboo leaves are so very smooth.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.800
Don't get ahead of yourself.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.600
Come on, stand still.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.050
Honestly!

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.540
It's so pretty!

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.050
Look at those beautiful colors.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.450
I can't wait to buy new clothes.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.000
It'd be nice to be able to get
into some new clothes.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.600
You're right.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.850
And you're always practically naked.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.100
It's not because I want to!

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.550
Let's split up here.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.150
We will head towards the repair shop.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:30.800
Okay.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.550
Ready?

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.200
Yeah.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.700
Nameless-chan, could you come with us?

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.160
But I don't know anything about shopping.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.150
They won't try to treat us fairly without men.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.350
Please, Master Bodyguard?

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.250
Okay.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.350
Too expensive!
Way too expensive!

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.450
Way too expensive!

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.200
Come on, it's bruised here!
Give us a deal!

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.400
Give us a deal!

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.600
You don't have anything thicker?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.000
Something this thin won't last three days!

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.450
I'll buy all this, so give me
a 50-percent discount!

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.350
You're charging 10 mon
for this skinny bean?

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.650
You've got to be joking!

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.150
I guess Kajika goes out
and fights battles too.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.450
What's that?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.050
Oh, those are fireworks.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.600
In Shitori, we set off fireworks for Tanabata.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.600
If you have fireworks,
you must have burst charges.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.850
Would you be able to spare some?

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.300
Sure, but what do you need them for?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.010
I thought I could use them as
a combustion agent for jet bullets.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.500
Jet bullets?

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.600
Oh, jet bullets are—

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.250
Hey.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.500
The barrel is acting up.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:51.950
It's urgent.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:53.950
One moment please.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.250
I will get right to it after
I finish with this customer.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.350
Huh?!

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.550
We were here first.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.650
A lowly steam smith
would oppose a Warrior?

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.350
He was talking to me before you got here!

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:06.850
You damn outsider!

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.050
What have you done?!

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.950
Damn it.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.350
Leave the screws!

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.450
Fix my gun first!

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.300
Pick it up.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.270
What?

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.850
Didn't your mother ever teach you
to pick up after yourself?!

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.700
How dare you!

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.450
Terrible form!

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.200
I will be back to pick it up by evening!

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.800
You'd better have it fixed by then!

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.500
The Warriors have nothing on the Corpses!

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.250
Oh, right.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.150
So jet bullets are...

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.450
Would you mind just hearing him out?

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:54.550
I'm sorry about this.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.850
Hey, are you from the Iron Fortress?

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.750
My dad's on a Railfort too.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.000
Really?

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.950
I guess that makes him one of us.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.200
Yeah. It's called the Tree Fortress.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.850
I'm sorry, I don't hear a lot
about other Railforts—

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.250
The Tree Fortress got
overrun by the Corpses.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.850
Sukari!

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.650
Everyone on it got turned into Corpses...

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.100
...before it rammed into Aragane Station.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.850
That's where we've escaped from.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.150
Why are you telling him this?!

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.200
It's more cruel to have him wait for
a father that's never coming back.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.750
I wish someone had
told me with my father.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.550
You're lying!

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:48.950
You're lying...!

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.600
My dad's not...!

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:52.750
I mean...

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.200
...he promised... he'd come back...

00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.600
Sorry.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.350
I didn't mean to make you cry.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.600
But... the real fight begins
when the tears dry up.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:15.850
He's late.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.700
We are unwelcomed guests after all.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.250
Food is precious everywhere.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.200
But not even granting us
an opportunity to negotiate...?

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.800
He's fighting the wrong enemy.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.400
You sound like Ikoma.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.150
Let me go talk to her.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.000
Ayame-sama!

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.100
Ku-Kurusu!

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.650
This... isn't...

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.150
M-My apologies.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.250
We should wait a little longer.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.000
Are you sure?

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.550
Don't we need too—

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.500
Just a little longer.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:01.800
What is this?

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.850
It is an honor to meet you.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.500
I am Ayame of the Yomokawa Family.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.590
I am Yamazaki the minister.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.550
More importantly...

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.350
A gift for Shitori-sama.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.400
They are jet bullets invented
by one of our young steam smiths.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.700
Please, allow us to give you
a demonstration for your benefit.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.150
Kurusu.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.700
Yes.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:24.100
Ready.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.600
What amazing power!

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.050
This could pierce through
the Corpse's heart cage.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.690
If you are interested, we can
include the blueprints as well.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:42.700
My!

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.900
It is only natural to help
each other in a time of need.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.200
I understand.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.550
I will promise you your food provisions.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.900
Could we ask if you could take in
our sick and injured as well?

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.100
Yes, of course.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.100
Minister!

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.000
I am keeping the heir of Yomokawa waiting.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.350
I ask that we keep this short.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.500
I am Kogenta, representing the Headquarters.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:13.100
This man is the former Ear of the Liberator...

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.000
I am Enoku.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.950
What business do the Hunters have?

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.500
He is working for us now.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.750
The Liberator will arrive here
in Shitori Station soon.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.450
Leave us out of it!

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.300
Shitori has nothing to do
with your power conflict!

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.450
At the very least, you are
not altogether uninvolved.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.300
Not after that day ten years ago.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.410
I'm back.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.040
Look at everything we bought!

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.350
Whoa, that's awesome!

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.920
Thank you.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.900
I can take him now.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.950
He falls right to sleep when
you carry him, Nameless.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.700
Oh, and this.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.600
What is it?

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.400
I had Kajika buy it for us!

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:07.350
Let's go home now.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.500
We have this lovely bamboo now.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.020
So that's what we need for Tanabata?

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.950
That's right.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.700
You write down your wish on a card...

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.800
...and hang them up like this.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.370
Well, let's go then!

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.150
We need to get back and decorate!

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.350
Why don't we grab a bite to eat in town?

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.200
Hey, good idea!

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:40.900
What's wrong?

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:42.700
Where's Nameless?

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.450
She was just here.

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.460
She didn't take her lunch with her.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.400
Honestly!

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.050
Lunch?

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.900
He means this.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.600
Oh.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.350
There you are.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.800
I looked everywhere for you!

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.500
What's with you?

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.400
You... forgot your lunch.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:17.900
Oh.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.750
Thanks.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.300
You'd better say "Thanks"
before you drink it.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.300
Thanks for the meal...

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.300
Thanks for the meal...

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.800
You know, I...

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.950
...have actually celebrated Tanabata before.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.100
I just forgot about it.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.500
But I remembered after
seeing the bamboo leaves.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.300
Is that so?

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.100
My mom...

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:52.950
...was putting up decorations.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:58.350
"Hozumi, we'll be able to see
the Milky Way tonight" she said.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.250
Hozumi?

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.000
That's my name.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.100
Before I met my brother.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:05.850
I wonder how it's written...

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.000
Probably...

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:20.950
I'm sure your mother gave that name in hopes
that you can eat as much rice as you could.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.950
Why are you laughing?

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.700
Because you're acting so serious.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.700
I'm sure I'm right!

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.200
Then my mother was stupid.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.400
Nobody's been able to make any rice in ages.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.250
And that's not what we eat anyway.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.850
We're talking like this now,

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.000
but we might turn into Corpses tomorrow.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.400
Or maybe today.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.800
It's something I always think about when I sleep.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.600
When I wake up in the morning...

00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:59.950
...will I still be me?

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.550
My mind might just be gone.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.000
Then everyone would get bitten
by me in the morning!

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.100
What a way to start the day, right?

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.250
Stop it.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.000
You should be human again.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.050
Stop fighting the Corpses.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.850
There's no need for you to fight
the Corpses if that's how you feel.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.750
I've decided.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.950
I'm going to turn you human again.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:44.250
Then I'm going to fill your belly with rice,
just like your mother wanted.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.350
Wait... uh... what are you talking about?!

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.450
You don't even know how
to turn me human again.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.700
Besides, you'll need to rebuild
the rice paddies to grow the rice first.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.950
You can't do that unless
the Corpses are gone.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.690
I'm saying I'm going to do all of that.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:01.750
That's impossible!

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.150
I'd be hard enough doing just one of them!

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.650
No, I've decided!

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:08.900
I'm turning you human again!

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.900
But if I'm not a Corpseless...

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.050
...I won't be able to fight anymore.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.100
You won't have to.

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.000
There won't be any Corpses left.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:22.750
Oh, right.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.400
You're right.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:32.700
We're back!

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.700
Oh, daita-iron!

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.750
Fantastic!

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.700
Wow, you're so good!

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.350
This is not what my sword
should be used for...!

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.200
What did you write?!

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.050
Hey, don't look!

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.250
Let's see now.

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.500
"I hope I can live through this and survive."

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.300
What else are we going to be wishing for?

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.100
Alright, I wrote mine too!

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.900
My wish is to...

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.850
...destroy the Corpses...

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.950
...and take back all our paddies and stations!

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.150
Don't you think you're asking for too much?

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.400
Then you're fine with just being alive?!

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:37.750
Not me!

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.250
I want more than just being alive!

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:41.700
I want more!

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.550
I have written mine as well.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.250
My wish is...

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.300
...to reopen Aragane Station!

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:55.600
Was that a strange thing to wish for?

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:57.250
No.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.650
I'm sure your father would be proud.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.150
I thought so too!

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.750
They're right.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.860
We should dream big!

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.820
Precisely because times are hard!

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.210
Alright!

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:12.200
I want to get rich and have
three beautiful wives!

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.200
Three?!

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.000
Dream big, right?

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.900
I want to become a teacher!

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.150
What did you write, Yukina-san?

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.350
I wished for my own Railfort.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.520
Could I ride on it too?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.490
Nope.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.400
What?

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.500
What did you write, Kurusu?

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.700
Ayame-sama, you can't!

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.530
It will not come true
if it's seen by others.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:35.850
Is that true?

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.450
I showed mine to everyone already.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.400
No...!

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:40.950
That is...!

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:43.950
What did you write, Nameless-chan?

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.800
I wished to eat a belly full of rice.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.400
Brother...

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:41.800
...it's okay...

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.150
...everyone's nice here...

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:49.950
Your brother was the one...

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.550
...who made you abandon the name "Hozumi"...

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.450
...and taught you that the weak
were only here to die?

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.500
If that's the case...

00:19:59.100 --> 00:19:59.800
I...

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.700
It's the Hunters!

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.200
Long live the Liberator!

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.400
Who are those people?

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:22.950
The Hunters.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:26.650
They're an independent force
created to exterminate the Corpses.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.150
They have a long history
of defeating the Corpses.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.200
They rid the land of the Corpses...

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.800
...and return it to the people.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.200
It's Biba-sama!

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.650
He is so beautiful!

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.650
As expected of the Warlord's son!

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:43.900
Brother!

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:46.700
Nameless!

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.630
I finally made it back to you!

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:49.700
You're safe?

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.270
"Brother"?

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.050
Nameless-chan's brother is...

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.850
...Biba-sama?!

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.100
Are you alone?

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.850
Where is Shimon?

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.610
Aragane Station was
attacked by the Corpses...

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.000
But he died honorably.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.550
I see...

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.860
May karma smile upon him.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.600
But I am glad you are alright.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:17.650
I have so much to tell you, brother!

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.200
The Iron Fortress has...

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:21.400
I have...

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.800
... to find out something.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.300
That's...

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.450
...whether he's a true hero or not.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:40.900
Even if the stars

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:46.000
That connect you make a sound

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:52.100
There are just dreams in the same rain

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:57.650
And lights are dried up

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:02.900
I am tired of getting answers

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:08.100
By mimicking others

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:13.700
Dawn without the sun

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.900
And broken morning

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:24.750
Smashed cry and dream
The ideal only has its doors

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:30.400
City is uplifted and drown in noise

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.900
I will still sing and stop turning the rudder

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:42.350
To hush silence
