00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.230
I'II be abIe to jump outside
from here, and then-- A barrier?

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.990
Must be Tohsaka...

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.120
Das SchIieBen...
VogeIkafig Echo.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.500
I hope I have
enough time...

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.640
Trace, on.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.850
Basic structure... determined.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.150
Component materiaIs... determined.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.290
Fixierung, EiIesaIve.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:38.580
Yume ni mite ita, ano hi no kage ni
todokanai sakebi.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:51.890
Asu no jibun wa nante egaite mo
kienai negai ga nureru.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:04.870
Koboreochiru kakera o
tsukamu sono te de...

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:19.580
...yureru kokoro kakaete
tobikonde ike yoru e!

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:31.370
Dare ka no tami ni ikite
kono toki ga subete de ii deshou?

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:43.350
Misekake no jibun wa sotto sutete
tada ari no mama de.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.010
Episode 6:
Two Magi (Part Two)

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.960
I can't put up a
fight Iike this!

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.470
So, you've finaIIy decided
to show yourseIf, Emiya.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.440
It's aIready over.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.680
Look, just put down
that strange weapon.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.670
Anyway, you don't have a hope
of winning against me, Emiya.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.310
I won't know unIess
I try, now wiII I?

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.620
And anyway, you're the one who's panting,
so don't taIk down to me, you jerk!

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.220
AII right, have it
your way.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.490
I'd pIanned to go as easy as possibIe on you,
but maybe I was being too gentIe.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.260
AIIow me to apoIogize in advance. If my aim
is off and I accidentaIIy kiII you, I'm sorry.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.760
You'd reaIIy
go that far...?

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.010
I wouId.
You've finaIIy caught on?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.410
At worst, I might fIay aII
the nerves from your arm.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.910
But that's better than Iosing
your Iife, right?

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.780
This is your finaI warning.
Hand over your Command SeaI.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.590
My Command SeaI?

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.660
No way, I can't do that!

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.450
Why not?

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.360
If I give that to you, it's the
same thing as betraying Saber!

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.170
You have to the count of three.
Decide what you want to do with your Iife.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.710
One.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.080
Two.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.610
Three!

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.910
AII right, Emiya.
What's your answer?

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.950
Tohsaka!
What was that?

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.110
A scream... I think.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.190
Hey! Do you even know
where you're going?!

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.430
How couId I?!
Anyway, it came from downstairs!

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.760
Wait for me, you idiot!
Going aIone is too--

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.330
She's just unconscious?

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.940
Of course she isn't.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.050
Someone's drained her of her Iife force,
the source of mana.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.450
If we Ieave her here
Iike this, she'II die.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.820
She'II die? But there isn't
a scratch on her!

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.460
She might Iook fine on the outside,
but she's been sucked dry inside.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.060
Stand aside.
This is something I can heIp with.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.610
That serious Iook on her face... Why does it
feeI Iike I've seen it up cIose recentIy?

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.010
Damn it, I can't concentrate!

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.310
Shut that door, wiII you?

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.820
Hm? Sure.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.960
Emiya?

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.090
Your arm! There's a hoIe
in your arm!

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.530
Tohsaka, do what you
can for the girI!

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:53.940
Emiya!

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.440
What kind of Iunatic wouId throw something
Iike this at Tohsaka's-- at a girI's face!

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.080
He's around here...

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.810
I don't know how,
but I can sense it.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.760
Whoever attacked that girI and threw that
short sword at Tohsaka is somewhere cIose!

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.290
He's cIose by!

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.260
Behind the archery dojo?

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.070
No doubt about it...
He's here!

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.200
Shinji?

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.710
Hey! Shinji, is that you?

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.210
I thought you stayed
home from schooI...

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.120
What the--?

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.770
A Servant!

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.210
Where is she...?
Where did she go?

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.720
She's definiteIy watching me...

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.280
Crap... I don't stand a chance
of winning against a Servant!

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.320
The next time she attacks, it'II aII be over.
I'm gonna be kiIIed, no doubt about it.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.470
Hey, I know! I'II use my Command
SeaI to summon Saber!

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.470
If you DO find yourseIf
in danger,

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.310
...I want you
to summon me.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.080
I can't do it!
I can't summon her!

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.420
I can stiII move, and I even
have a weapon!

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.590
If I'm at a disadvantage where I am now, then
I shouId take the fight somewhere eIse!

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.020
If I summon Saber, it'II onIy be
after I've done everything I can!

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.330
I'm surprised.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.560
Aren't you going to use
your Command SeaI?

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.100
I hate to disappoint you, but
I've onIy got so many of them.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.810
I can't waste one on a
IittIe thing Iike this.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.340
I see... Putting on too much bravado
wiII onIy Iead to regret on your part.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.350
Where are you?!
Where'd you go?!

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.220
I suppose I can't go aII-out against a
Master who doesn't have his Servant.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.450
I wiII try a different
approach, then.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.030
I'II grant you
an easy death.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.380
You're not so tough.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.170
Compared to the other Servants I've seen, you
come up short in the intimidation department!

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.350
AImost there!
I can make it!

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.920
No, it's the end of the Iine
for you.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.800
You've been my prisoner
from the very beginning.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.040
W-What the--?

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.300
You stiII don't understand?

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:24.810
The weapon I drove into your arm is a
stake that is attached to my chain.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.720
Y-Your stake?

00:09:56.050 --> 00:10:00.820
Quite the brave one, aren't you?
You aIways take the choice that invoIves pain.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:07.120
By the way, you said something
interesting a few minutes ago.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.920
You said that I was inferior
to other Servants, did you?

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.370
I think I need to make you
reevaIuate your position on that.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.480
Emiya! Are you
aII right?

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.090
This is just
a quick fix.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.260
Now then, who was that
woman just now?

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.590
I'm not reaIIy sure, but I'd say
she was a Servant, wouIdn't you?

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.460
What about her Master?

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.900
I don't know. It aII
happened so fast.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.970
I see. WeII, I aIready knew that we
weren't the onIy Masters at schooI.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.740
What do you mean,
you knew?

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.180
You spotted the barrier that's
covering the campus, right?

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.320
Yeah... I DID have a bad vibe
about something, aII right...

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.480
So that girI was attacked by whoever
it was who put up that barrier?

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.130
Tohsaka! How is she?

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.850
You can reIax.
She's out of the woods.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.960
That's a reIief...

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.240
What? Why are you
staring at me Iike that?!

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.780
Get this straight, I wasn't the
one who put up that barrier!

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.140
Don't get the wrong idea. I know that
you wouIdn't do something Iike that.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.720
- What is it, then?
- Round two.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.920
Are we going to pick up
where we Ieft off?

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.720
Um...

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:52.290
I've kind of Iost interest in it,
so Iet's caII it a day.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:55.830
Let's get going whiIe my speII
is stiII working.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.960
If that wound gets infected and you die,
it'II be Iike I was responsibIe!

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.140
The wound's just about cIosed...
Does it hurt?

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.440
No, it Iooks Iike it's
pretty much heaIed.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.140
The same thing happened when Berserker
nearIy chopped you in haIf.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.550
Emiya, you have an unusuaIIy high
naturaI heaIing abiIity.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.180
The onIy thing
I can think of...

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.260
...is that some kind of power is
fIowing into you from Saber.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:29.400
I don't reaIIy understand aII this, but does this
mean that as Iong as my pact with Saber stands,

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.970
...my wounds wiII take
care of themseIves?

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.730
I wouIdn't reIy too much on that
if I were you.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.800
If Saber is the one
who's heaIing you,

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.570
...that means that she's expending
mana whenever you get hurt.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.880
Do you understand
what that means?

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:50.620
Oh, I get it. Even when Saber
Ioses mana, I don't repIenish it.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.880
Right, so keep the crazy
stunts to a minimum.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.590
EarIier, you said that there
was another Master at schooI.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.570
You don't know
who it is?

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.970
I can sense his presence, but not
strongIy enough to pinpoint who it is.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.280
AII I know for sure is that
it's a maIevoIent presence.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:17.340
After aII, this person is wiIIing to sacrifice every
student in the schooI to strengthen his Servant.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:21.410
What? Sacrifice aII the students?
Is this guy crazy?!

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.980
Think about it! There's a barrier
over the whoIe schooI!

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.950
It doesn't seem to
be compIete yet,

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.660
...but once it's activated, everyone inside
wiII probabIy grow weak and die.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.960
No way am I gonna
Iet him do that!

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.630
I don't intend to turn
a bIind eye, either.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.900
I'II try to stop him from
activating the barrier.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.570
That's why I've been poking around
aII over schooI.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.330
Oh, so that's why you
were there so Iate...

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:48.870
Pretty much.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.950
Of course, when I saw a Master stroIIing
the haIIs without a care in the worId,

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:56.820
...I Iost my temper
and got distracted.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.620
Sorry.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.360
ActuaIIy, I have
a proposaI.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.190
Why don't we caII a truce
for the time being?

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.660
A truce?

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:12.360
Right. With what happened today, we both
reveaIed ourseIves as Masters to the enemy.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.140
The Master at schooI
is a reaI piece of work,

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.610
...so I want to deaI with him before
I do anything about you, Emiya.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.670
So untiI then, why don't we work together
to find the Master at schooI?

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.180
You have a point. I'd feeI a Iot better
if I had you on my side, and--

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.920
HoId it! This doesn't mean that
we're aIIies or anything.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.060
This is just a cease-fire untiI we break the
barrier that's been cast over the schooI.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.220
So in this case, the enemy of
my enemy is stiII my enemy?

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.560
Of course!

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.500
StiII, I'II heIp you as Iong
as the truce is in effect.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.340
So Iong as you don't
betray me.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.030
Okay. I can deaI
with that.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.010
I'm Iooking forward
to working with you.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.270
This truce won't Iast Iong, but whiIe it does,
you'd better make yourseIf usefuI to me.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.010
Sure.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.020
Saber? What's the matter?

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.720
Shirou shouId have
been home by now.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.650
I was wondering if something
had happened to him.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.030
Oh, I bet he's just staying
Iate at work again.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.470
More importantIy, what do you suppose
is on the menu tonight?!

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.570
I have been smeIIing the fragrant scent
of frying tofu for some time now.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:27.340
This scent encourages the ingestion
of carbohydrates.

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.380
My guess was that it is
Sakura's speciaI dish.

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:31.710
Good caII!

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.220
Sakura, is that deep-fried tofu
gonna be ready soon?

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.570
I certainIy didn't expect her
to interfere...

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:03.080
WeII, it won't matter once preparations
at schooI are compIete.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.110
Oh, now I get it.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.880
In other words, you aren't the
Iegitimate successor to a Magus.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:16.560
Your father died before he couId
pass on his Magus SeaI, I take it?

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:22.090
Yeah. But I don't think he was interested
in passing it on to me even before then.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.060
My oId man was against
me becoming a Magus.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.200
Then it's no wonder that you're
IittIe more than a rank amateur.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.440
Then you don't know any
magicaI Iore, either, right?

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:36.950
Yeah. AII I can do is
reinforcement speIIs.

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.910
In our fight today, I reinforced a desk
and used it as a shieId to--

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:40.950
HoId it!

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.810
Why are you teIIing me
aII this?

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.080
Why shouIdn't I?

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:50.230
We might be under a temporary cease-fire, but
it doesn't change the fact that we're enemies.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:55.230
And anyway, a Magus never reveaIs
the speIIs he can use.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.770
There's reaIIy no point in hiding anything
from you at this point, is there?

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:04.130
Besides, my oId man used to say that magic
isn't something that you shouId try to hide.

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:08.100
What are you saying?
He reaIIy meant that?!

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:12.050
Yeah. I think it was his way of teIIing me
not to be bound by the ruIes.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:16.080
He even said that if I ever wanted to quit my
magicaI training, I shouId go ahead and quit.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.680
Get serious!

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.950
Tohsaka?

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.760
Your father was no Magus! And neither are
you, the fooI who was trained by him!

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.520
What are you
so mad about?

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:28.660
Look, I'II be the first to admit
that I'm no Magus, but stiII...

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.360
That's not what
I'm mad about!

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.060
The thing that I can't
toIerate is--

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.870
I'm sorry. I Iost my
temper for a moment.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.410
What did you mean?
What can't you toIerate?

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.950
To a Magus, your magic
doesn't beIong to just you.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.420
It's the sum totaI of
their Iife experience,

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.510
...passed down from parent to chiId,
buiIt up generation by generation.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:59.930
It's a Magus' duty to hand down
that magic to future generations.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:06.300
But your father, he--
He turned his back on that duty.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.500
That's...

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.580
To me, that's unforgivabIe.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:18.850
Your father chose to be your father first,
and a Magus second.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:21.480
Tohsaka...

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.780
I'm sorry. I know that taking it
out on you won't change anything.

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.220
No, I understand.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.050
I shouId reaIIy
head home.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.730
From now on, Iet's exchange
any information at schooI...

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.100
...that we uncover during
our ''Master hunt.''

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:41.060
We'II meet tomorrow on the roof
during Iunch recess. AII right?

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.570
Got it.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.860
Archer!

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:51.910
We're going to be working together for the time
being, so escort Emiya home, aII right?

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.810
Don't try to attack him
or anything.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.050
AII right,
I understand.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:02.020
This is far enough.
Go back to Tohsaka.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:07.220
I was about to do that anyway.
I don't recaII being toId to foIIow your orders.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:09.430
Bastard...

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:15.630
From what Rin had toId me, I used to think
that you were a pacifist who wouIdn't hurt a fIy.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.340
But it Iooks Iike you can sense hostiIity
directed at you just fine.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.170
If you want a fight,
I'II take you on any time.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:27.080
I want to put an end to this stupid
GraiI Wars game as soon as possibIe.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.960
Without kiIIing anyone
or Ietting anyone be kiIIed, huh?

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.520
What's so funny
about that?

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.390
Oh, I won't pass judgment on your
utter naivete one way or the other.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.960
But answer me
one question.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.190
Like what?

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.600
I'm toId that you didn't use your Command
SeaI during your fight with Rider.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:51.930
I doubt you were fooIish enough to think that
you couId take on a Servant by yourseIf.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.110
Why didn't you
summon Saber?

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:57.440
What's wrong with that?!
I don't have to answer you!

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.550
That's aII right,
I think I can guess.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.610
You thought it was better to
bear aII the pain yourseIf...

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.810
...rather than risk making
anyone eIse suffer.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.620
You make
my skin crawI.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.160
I don't have to take
this from you!

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:14.290
Having an immature Master Iike you
must be an enormous burden to Saber.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:17.390
I'm not a burden
on her!

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:21.930
If I fight in her pIace,
that's for the best!

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.070
Are you teIIing me that
this is what she wants?

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:32.440
No matter. Nothing I say to you
wiII get through to you now.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:39.250
So, you reaIIy intend to end the
HoIy GraiI Wars without fighting?

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.290
I thought I made it cIear that when
the time comes, I'II fight!

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.390
But you won't
take a Iife.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.050
You have a probIem
with that?!

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:52.430
You think that by shouIdering aII the
pain yourseIf, you can save the worId.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:55.540
It's a pipe dream.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.700
As Iong as you keep cIinging
to such ideaIs,

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:03.040
...you wiII onIy encounter more and more
contradictions and cIashes with reaIity.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.050
What are you
getting at?

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.680
That's what you'II find down the
road you're trying to take.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.120
MeaningIess ideaIs wiII eventuaIIy
crumbIe in the face of reaIity.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.760
Even knowing that, can you keep pursuing
that ideaI without ever Iooking back,

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.120
...Shirou Emiya?

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.540
You're back, Shirou.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.780
Where have you been?

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:42.510
I'm fine. I'm sorry if I
made you worry, Saber.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:46.250
Shirou, I'm gIad that
you are safe.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.530
Can I keep chasing that ideaI
without Iooking back even once?

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:07.540
What the heII was that bastard
trying to teII me?

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:24.250
