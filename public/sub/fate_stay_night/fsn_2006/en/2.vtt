00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.590
I drew the most powerfuI card,
no doubt about it...

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.180
Oh, brother...

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.090
Looks Iike I've been drawn by quite
the unusuaI IittIe Master...

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.890
The thing is, when you save
one person's Iife,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.330
...it means that you won't be abIe
to save someone eIse's.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.110
WeII, I'm off. You know what to do
when I'm gone, don't you?

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.370
Yes, Father.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.580
Back then, my young mind
knew the truth.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.220
I knew that he probabIy wasn't
going to come back.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.290
A war had begun.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.130
Not a war fought between countries,
but one between a mere seven Magi.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.300
Rin, the HoIy GraiI
wiII appear one day.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.910
It is the duty of the Tohsaka
famiIy to obtain it.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.540
It is a path that we can't
turn away from.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.940
I know that you wiII be abIe
to take care of yourseIf.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.260
I wasn't abIe to
summon Saber...

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.860
Even though I worked Iong and hard
for ten whoIe years to summon Saber,

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.340
...who is said to be the most
powerfuI of the Servants...

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.270
You're moping
about that again?

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.900
Don't worry about it, I'm not disappointed
in you or anything.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.480
It's just... I'm irritated with myseIf
for missing my mark.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.150
You make exceIIent tea.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.480
Thank you
for saying so.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.620
Now, the name ''Archer'' is just the
designation of your CIass, isn't it?

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.820
As a Master, I feeI I have the right
to know my Servant's...

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.030
...true name, Iineage, and what
country's Epic Spirit he is.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.030
Don't try to teII me that you stiII
can't remember who you are.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.100
Is it even possibIe for a Servant
to not remember his own true name?

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.170
I don't know. But my
memories are jumbIed.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.320
It's a side-effect of your
imperfect summoning.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.580
What's that supposed
to mean?

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.890
You're impIying that you don't know who you
are because I botched your summoning?

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.690
WeII, there's more to it
than that...

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.820
Anyway, I'm not missing anything important.
Don't Iet it bother you.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.330
But it does bother me!

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.730
It wiII be hard to formuIate a strategy if I
don't know what sort of Epic Spirit you are,

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.130
...and I don't even know
how powerfuI you are!

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.730
There's onIy one thing that
I can say on that score.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.870
And what's that?

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.570
That you are a
superior Master, Rin.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.880
In terms of both Command SeaIs
and magicaI power,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.080
...it's safe to say that you're
the most powerfuI.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.250
And as the Servant summoned
by such a Master as you,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.590
...how couId I be anything
but the most powerfuI?

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.920
FIattery wiII
get you nowhere.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.390
I mereIy speIIed out
the facts.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.400
Oh, weII. It means that our enemies
won't know who you reaIIy are, either.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.560
Let's just say that I'II Iearn about you
as time goes on, and Ieave it at that.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.430
But that said...

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.140
''The HoIy GraiI Wars shaII be conducted by
seven Masters and their seven Servants.''

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.950
I wonder if aII seven Masters
are gathered together yet?

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.980
That is a
very good question.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:48.120
Yume ni mite ita, ano hi no kage ni
todokanai sakebi.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:04:00.710
Asu no jibun wa nante egaite mo
kienai negai ga nureru.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:14.090
Koboreochiru kakera o
tsukamu sono te de...

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:28.830
...yureru kokoro kakaete
tobikonde ike yoru e!

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:40.580
Dare ka no tami ni ikite
kono toki ga subete de ii deshou?

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:52.560
Misekake no jibun wa sotto sutete
tada ari no mama de.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.040
Episode 2:
FatefuI Night

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.740
You made enough to feed an army again.
Can we actuaIIy eat aII this?

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.780
These here are for
my boxed Iunch.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.750
I'm experiencing a cash fIow probIem at the
moment, so this is a big heIp, Sakura!

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.850
It's for your Iunch, huh?

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.720
Making Sakura cook for you is a fIagrant
abuse of authority, Fuji-nee.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.920
No, if she doesn't mind having the same
thing I am, it's no extra work for me.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.590
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.870
If you're feeIing jeaIous, why not drop by
the archery cIub during Iunch break?

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.900
If you do, I'II share
it with you...

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.170
Say, Sakura...

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.240
Yes?

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.440
I reaIIy appreciate you coming over every day
to heIp out around the house,

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.810
...but I wish you'd at Ieast
take weekends off.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.450
I mean, I'm sure you and
your friends go out and stuff.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.220
No, I don't reaIIy
have any pIans.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.260
I don't reaIIy go out just
because it's the weekend.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.760
Um, but if I was meeting someone, or personaI
business to see to, that's another matter...

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.570
Oh, okay. WeII, don't put
yourseIf out on my account.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.360
Sure, Sempai.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.970
Sempai? What happened
to your hand?

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.180
Huh?

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.910
When did that happen?

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.210
Maybe I cut it when I was fiddIing around
with that junk Iast night.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.850
Don't worry, it doesn't hurt,
and it'II stop bIeeding soon.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.720
It's nothing to
worry about.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.750
WeII, if you
say so.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.520
Good morning,
Emiya!

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.260
Oh, hey, Mitsuzuri.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.420
Don't give me that, ''Oh, hey'' stuff.
You're as coId as aIways, Emiya.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.730
- WeII, I shouId go.
- Sure.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.700
Excuse me, Sempai.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.860
Sure thing!

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.470
So, how's your
archery doing?

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.380
Not too bad.
Come by and watch Iater.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.940
Oh, and if you couId babysit Shinji
for me, it wouId be a big heIp.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.180
Shinji? What's he done
this time?

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.750
He's been going
out of controI IateIy.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.820
If I take my eye off him for a second,
he acts Iike he owns the pIace.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.360
The other day, he deIiberateIy made some boy
students who had bareIy touched a bow before...

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.000
...take shots in front
of the girIs.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.900
He made Iaughing stocks of them
untiI they hit the target.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.730
Don't teII me you just
stood by and--

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.240
Of course I didn't Iet him
get away with it!

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.230
But as team captain, I'm busy
with a dozen different things.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.080
I can't be in the dojo aII the time, so
I wasn't abIe to catch him in the act.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.390
When I try to griII him about it, that
jerk Shinji aIways gives me the sIip!

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.050
I swear, that boy
pisses me off!

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.950
StiII, I have to wonder what's
gotten into Shinji's head?

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.820
He's got to know that there's
a huge difference between...

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.490
...tough instruction and setting the
beginners up for pubIic ridicuIe.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.720
From what I heard, he got shot down
pretty hard by that Rin Tohsaka girI.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.730
B-By Tohsaka?

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.640
The one thing that boy
has in spades is pride,

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.410
...and it sounds Iike Tohsaka merciIessIy
smashed it into a miIIion pieces.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.680
Shinji Matou.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.980
We've been friends ever since middIe schooI,
and he's aIso Sakura's big brother.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.830
Isn't it a IittIe earIy to be bugging me, Emiya?
Is there something you wanted?

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.990
No, it's no big deaI.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.440
I was just wondering how things
were going with your after-schooI cIub.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.360
Why is a guy who quit the archery cIub
so worried about the team?

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.940
We're piIing on the wins Iike cIockwork.
I'm on the team, after aII.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.140
GIad to hear it. If there's anything
I can heIp with, Iet me know.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.370
You were never good at stringing the
bows or fixing them, remember?

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.420
Oh, that. WeII, unIike you, I've never been
interested in meniaI Iabor Iike that.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.620
I'II come to you the next time
it comes up.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.440
- Do you feeI it, Archer?
- Yes.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.840
I sense the presence of an enemy nearby.
It's been watching us for a whiIe now.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.080
It doesn't seem to want
to attack us right away.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.610
It appears to be biding its time,
waiting for an opportunity to strike.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.720
Interesting. Let's just take a wait-and-see
approach untiI everyone Ieaves.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.060
What do you think? It's aIways
been acting up,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.170
...but I think it's gone to
its finaI reward this time.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.470
Hey, I might be good, but even I can't
bring it back if it's died of oId age.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.810
It's a Iost cause, huh?

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.850
Issei, can you go get my
tooIbox from my Iocker?

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.570
You mean you can--

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.620
I don't think it's given up
the ghost just yet.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.080
I owe you one!

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.120
Hey, you're stiII here, Emiya?

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.760
Must be nice to have so much time on your
hands that you can goof off here so Iate.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.000
I'm jeaIous!

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.000
I haven't been
goofing off.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.140
Issei asked me to fix a piece of equipment
in the student counciI room.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.510
Oh, you were sucking up to
the student counciI, huh?

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.780
Then wouId you mind doing
a IittIe job for me, too?

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.220
The archery dojo is IittIe
messy at the moment.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.840
As you can see,
I'm a IittIe busy.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.250
Sorry, but wouId you mind
straightening it up for me?

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.260
But didn't Miss Fujimura teII you to
cIean it yourseIf, Matou Sempai?

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.460
But if I stayed here to cIean up,
the restaurants wouId be cIosed, right?

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.640
If he does the work for me,
it's just as good, right?

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.430
Doesn't that seem
kinda mean?

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.170
You don't have a probIem
with it, do you, Emiya?

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.830
Sure, I don't mind.
After aII, I've got nowhere eIse to be.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.410
Great, that settIes it!
C;'mon, Iadies, Iet's go!

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.940
Are you sure he
doesn't mind?

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.920
It's fine. For as Iong as I've known him,
he's aIways Ioved to heIp peopIe out.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.180
I can't beIieve it...

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.650
What kind of idiot
is he?

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.850
CarefuI, he can hear you!

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.760
Okay, might as weII do this right
whiIe I have the chance!

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.240
Here we go!

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:26.260
It's here. Looks Iike it was
waiting for sunset.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.150
It's coming in
to attack.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.030
The maIice it's giving off
is incredibIe...

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.500
HeIIo there!

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.490
Nice night, isn't it?

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.060
Don't you think so,
too, buddy?

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.410
He can see Archer!

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.340
I knew it,
he's a Servant!

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.400
That's right.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.700
And the fact that you know that means I can
assume that you're my enemy, IittIe Iady!

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.950
Archer!

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.290
You handIe the Ianding!

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.630
His weapon is a Iance. We need to find a pIace
where our strengths wiII give us the edge.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.240
Archer!

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:22.710
Oh, you catch on quick!
That's more Iike it!

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.810
So, you're a spear wieIder.
A Lancer Servant.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.550
Indeed I am.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:32.450
Your Servant there doesn't Iook Iike the type
who fights in a proper man-to-man fight.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.650
Which makes you
an Archer, I assume?

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.420
No matter. Now that we've run into
each other, we have to fight.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.220
Come at me.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:44.830
How do you want me to handIe this, Rin?
I've been ready to go for a Iong time now.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:52.340
Archer, show me
what you've got!

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.310
This IowIy bowman Iikes to think
he's a knight, huh?

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.350
What was that?
Did that come from the schooI yard?

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.270
Who the heII are
those two...?

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:39.450
What country's hero are you? I've never
heard of a bowman who uses twin swords!

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:44.150
But it's easy to teII who you are! There's onIy
one spearman of your caIiber in aII the worId!

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.220
A homicide.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.790
They were kiIIed by a katana
or a spear or something Iike that.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:55.410
Who's there?!

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.630
Oh, no! There wasn't supposed
to be anyone stiII here!

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.290
What the heII was going on
back there?!

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.330
HeIIo there!

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.630
Wow, you sure covered
a Iot of distance.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.740
WeII, today just wasn't your Iucky day.
Now that you've seen us, you have to die.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.010
''Dead men teII no taIes,''
and aII that.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.530
I'II never...

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:59.970
I'II never become a champion of justice
if I die Iike this...

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.540
It's my fauIt...
He's dead because of me.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.750
I thought I had resigned myseIf to the fact
that there wouId be casuaIties...!

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:21.720
Go after that Lancer, Archer. He'II probabIy
go back to where his Master is.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.290
We need to at Ieast find out
what his Master Iooks Iike.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:25.620
Understood.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:35.060
I'm sorry. The Ieast I can do
is sit with you whiIe you die.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.910
No way... Are you kidding me?
Why you?

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.910
Why did it have
to be you?

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.450
Why you?

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.180
I'm sorry, Father.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.060
Your daughter is
a heartIess girI.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:06.630
RepIicate, repIace destroyed internaI organs.
SimuItaneousIy restore heart.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.800
W-Who's there...?

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:14.500
Dad, I swore to you,
remember...?

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:22.950
I swore that if I ever became a magic-user,
I'd save someone's Iife, but now...

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.170
I... I'm aIive.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.810
Dear Sempai: I'm going home. Good night.
Signed, Sakura

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.390
Who were those
two guys?

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.490
They weren't human.
Ghosts, then?

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:10.030
No, they had soIid form and were
trying to kiII each other.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.770
I was nearIy kiIIed, too.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:18.240
No, I reaIIy did die.
From a thrust to the heart.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:23.340
But someone who was there
saved me.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.320
Did you get any resuIts?

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.980
Sorry, but no. His Master
is very cautious.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.650
At the very Ieast, that Lancer's Master
wasn't on this side of the river.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.590
I see. WeII, there's nothing eIse
for it, then.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.160
I must say, I'm surprised.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.390
You squandered a precious jeweI
to save the Iife of a witness.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:47.430
No one asked you! I stiII have a huge stock of
gems, so I don't need to be stingy with them!

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:52.640
Rin, what concerns me is the reason
you took that particuIar action.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.040
Our battIe mustn't be seen
by anyone.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:02.080
The ruIe is that in the event you are spotted,
that person must be siIenced at once.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:09.890
Even Lancer put the eIimination of the
witness ahead of his battIe with us.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:17.470
PIus, he's going to reaIize sooner
or Iater that the witness is stiII aIive.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.200
I didn't think of that! If the witness is
stiII aIive, Lancer wiII never Iet him go!

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.210
It's him!

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.670
He foIIowed me!

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.340
A weapon... Need some kind
of weapon...

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.250
How couId this get
any worse?

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:43.080
But if I've hit bottom,
there's nowhere to go but up!

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.030
Trace, on!

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.860
Component eIements...
Reinforcement compIete!

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.370
AII right, come on!
I'm ready for you this time!

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.910
I was being thoughtfuI in my own way,
giving you a painIess death...

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:08.990
I can't beIieve I'm being forced to kiII
the same person twice in one day.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.150
Don't wander off
this time!

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.320
Oh, now this is a surprise.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.430
Now I get it. That expIains why you're
stiII aIive even after I skewered your heart.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.540
It's faint, but I sense some
magicaI power in you.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.970
I swear, you're taking on a whoIe mess
of unnecessary troubIe, you know that?

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.370
Yes, I think so, too.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.310
AII right, it's time to end
this game of hide-and-seek.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.390
Just give up.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.600
Shit!

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.430
Checkmate.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:39.710
You gave me quite a surprise, boy.
Maybe you were meant to be the seventh.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.980
The seventh what?

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.550
Either way, it's aII over
for you.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.890
Are you kidding me?

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:55.950
I was given a second chance at Iife.
I'm not gonna give in without a fight!

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.890
No way am I gonna die a pointIess
death Iike this!

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:01.400
I'm not gonna
Iet you kiII me!

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.240
Wha--?

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:12.910
What's that?!

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:39.400
I am Saber, your Servant. I am come
in response to your summons.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:45.870
I ask you...
Are you my Master?

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.510
My voice was stuck
in my throat.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.620
Maybe it was out of confusion
over the insanity around me.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.350
No, that wasn't it.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:22:00.890
I was struck speechIess by
the overwheIming beauty...

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.790
...of this girI who had appeared
before my eyes.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:24.170
Fukai fukai mori no naka

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.980

Next Time

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:45.460
Next Time
Fate Stay Night.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.930
Fate Stay Night.
