00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.500
If you truIy wish to give up
your status as Master,

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.740
...your onIy option is to obtain the HoIy GraiI
and make your wish come true.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.480
If you wish to erase those invisibIe burns that
you carry, simpIy accept your stigmata.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.260
Shirou Emiya, as one of
the chosen Masters,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.730
...do you or do you not have the determination
to fight in the HoIy GraiI Wars?

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.730
I'II fight.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.830
Good evening, mister. This is the second
time we've met Iike this, isn't it?

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.600
This is bad! That thing
is way out of our Ieague!

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.030
How do you do, Rin?
I am IIIya.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.160
IIIyasvieI von Einzbern.
I assume you've heard of me?

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.970
Einzvern...

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.810
I suppose there's no point in
making any more introductions.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.900
After aII, you're aII
going to die here.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.010
Okay, I'm gonna
kiII you now!

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.450
Go get them,
Berserker!

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:50.000
Yume ni mite ita, ano hi no kage ni
todokanai sakebi.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:02:02.380
Asu no jibun wa nante egaite mo
kienai negai ga nureru.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:15.960
Koboreochiru kakera o
tsukamu sono te de...

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:30.810
...yureru kokoro kakaete
tobikonde ike yoru e!

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:42.220
Dare ka no tami ni ikite
kono toki ga subete de ii deshou?

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:54.440
Misekake no jibun wa sotto sutete
tada ari no mama de.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.810
Episode 4:
The Strongest Enemy

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.280
Shirou, get back!

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.580
Saber!

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.470
Saber!

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.270
He's swinging around that enormous
sword Iike it was a toy!

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.070
Get her! Get her!

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.990
Saber!

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.470
Berserker, you have her now!
Finish her off once and for aII!

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.660
That's--

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.230
Saber!

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.870
Don't do it!

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:32.870
Tohsaka?

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.070
Vier StiI ErschieBung!

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.620
What the heII is that
thing's body made of?!

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.090
This is hopeIess!
Get out of there, Saber!

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.340
Saber!

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.980
Saber...

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.390
Saber?

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.000
Why...?

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.050
Oh, come on,
you can't possibIy win.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.680
My berserker here is Greece's
most powerfuI hero.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.490
Greece's most powerfuI hero?
It can't be!

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.370
That's right. What you see standing
before you is the deviI named HercuIes.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.990
HercuIes?!

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.770
That's right. He's the most
powerfuI monster there is.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.000
He's head and shouIders above any hero
that the Iikes of you peopIe couId command.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.180
AII right, Berserker. She's going to regenerate,
so chop her head off and then kiII her.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.290
B-But I...

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.100
I can't just...!

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.500
Why, you...!

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.220
Shirou!

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.160
Shirou!

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.540
Why did he
do that?

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.040
Enough of this. I'm bored.
Berserker!

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.090
Rin. Just so we're cIear, the next time
we meet, I'm going to kiII you.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.880
What the heII were
you thinking?! Sheesh!

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.940
It's not as if you couId've
done anything to heIp her!

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.830
When I was young, I used to aspire
to becoming a champion of justice.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:27.460
What do you mean, ''used to''?
You gave up on it?

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.000
Yes, as much as
I hate to admit to.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.380
Heroes onIy remain heroes
for a brief time,

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.410
...and when you grow up, it becomes more
and more difficuIt to caII yourseIf one.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:42.010
I onIy wish that it hadn't taken me
so Iong to reaIize that.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.990
I didn't know. WeII, I guess it's
a Iost cause for you, then...

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.460
You're right.
It reaIIy is a Iost cause.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.970
Since it's a Iost cause for you,
I'II become one in your pIace.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:03.140
It's too Iate for you because you're
an aduIt, but I can probabIy stiII do it.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.440
Leave it to me. I'II make
your dreams a reaIity.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.180
Thanks.
That's a reIief.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.790
Ow...

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.890
What's this bIood?

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.360
What happened
Iast night...?

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.410
Good morning.
I Iet myseIf in, Emiya.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.650
W-What are you
doing here?

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.750
You know, you don't have
any decent tea in the house.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.590
If you're going to use tea bags, at Ieast
keep the trianguIar kind on hand.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.460
T-Tohsaka, what are you--

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.550
HoId it right there!

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.730
Don't you think you shouId thank
me first for carrying you home?

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.110
Carrying me?

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.380
I remember!

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.550
Now I remember!
That big monster, he--

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.090
Huh? Why am I
stiII aIive?

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.000
Huh? Why am I
stiII aIive?

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.540
You started heaIing aII
on your own afterwards.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.370
What do you mean,
''on my own''?

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.070
From what I've seen, Saber seems to
have a naturaI regeneration abiIity,

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.680
...so maybe you're tapping
into that somehow.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:32.250
It's essentiaIIy impossibIe for a Master to be
suppIied with magicaI power by a Servant.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.490
But then again, you ARE
an impossibIe Master...

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.120
What's that supposed
to mean?

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.330
It's unheard of for a Master
to try to save a Servant.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.700
And besides, if you die,
Saber wiII disappear, too.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.840
Emiya, what do you pIan
to do now?

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.180
I just don't want to see a repeat
of what happened ten years ago.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.410
I'm not interested in this
''HoIy GraiI' deaI.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.080
I knew you were going
to say that.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.990
Look, Saber wiII kiII you if she
hears you taIking Iike that!

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.590
She wiII?

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:16.470
Did you think that Servants obey humans
without wanting something in return?

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.010
Whoever wins the GraiI
gets their wish granted.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.340
This incIudes the Servants,
their guardians.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.980
They answer a Master's summons because
they want to get their hands on the GraiI, too.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.140
Each of them has a desire
that they want granted.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.350
That's why Saber is doing this?
Because she wants the GraiI?

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.190
But Saber is just as human as I am!
Last night, she was bIeeding aII over!

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:49.500
Servants aren't aIive. If they ''die,'' they
just go back to where they came from.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.170
That doesn't make it okay for them
to go around kiIIing each other.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.970
If you Ieave those other Masters running
unchecked, innocent peopIe are going to die!

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.410
Servants use magicaI power
as fueI.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.840
The more of this fueI
they take in,

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.990
...the more they can unIeash the power
that they had when they were aIive.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.450
What're you getting at?

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:15.920
They're spirituaI entities, so they wouId
get sustenance from eating souIs.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.790
I'm saying that some Masters
wiII force their Servants...

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.570
...to attack peopIe and eat their souIs
to boIster their magicaI power.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.540
Wha--? Servants eat peopIe?!

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.340
No, you wrong...
Saber wouId never do that!

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:44.290
So, what wiII you do? Sit back and watch,
regardIess of what the other Masters do?

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.380
If they try something,
I'II just have to stop them.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.690
Oh, good grief... You won't try to defeat
a Master on your own initiative,

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.530
...but if another Master does something
bad, THEN you'II go after him?

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.600
You reaIize that you're
contradicting yourseIf, right?

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:05.910
I know I'm trying to have it both ways,
but I can't think of any other way to do this.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.780
There's just one probIem with that.
Mind if I teII you what that is?

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.610
Like what?

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.120
That Master from Iast night is definiteIy
going to come to kiII us.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.490
That IittIe girI's Servant is in
an entireIy different Ieague.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.300
If we just sit around and wait,
it's obvious what the resuIt wiII be.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.360
You probabIy won't even get
the chance to defend yourseIf.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.100
Her Servant... She said
that he's HercuIes?

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.570
She's seriousIy
mocking us.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:42.240
Letting your opponent know your hero's
true name exposes their vuInerabiIities.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.010
Hey, that's right! I wonder
what Saber's true name is?

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.820
It might be smarter not
to have her teII you.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.960
For one thing, you Iook Iike the type
who might bIab it to outsiders.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.650
Outsiders? You mean yourseIf,
Tohsaka?

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.530
I don't recaII joining
your famiIy.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.760
You didn't need
to see me out.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.270
I forgot to thank you
for what you did.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.170
You know, for carrying me home.
Thank you.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:21.610
From now on, it'II be easier for you if
you didn't think of me as a human being.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.990
The HoIy GraiI Wars...

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.990
Now that I've signed on board, I can't survive
unIess I muscIe my way past my opponents.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.640
And depending on how I do that,
innocent peopIe might get hurt.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.510
But if I don't
do something, I--

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.300
Rejoice, my son!

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.110
Your wish wiII
at Iong Iast come true.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.500
He's wrong... I'm doing this because
I want to save peopIe.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.930
I don't want anyone
to die.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.530
Shirou, stand back!

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.770
Saber tried to
protect me.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.280
Even when she
was so badIy hurt...

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.320
That's right!
What about Saber?!

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.660
Good morning, Sakura!

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.820
Good morning. What are
you doing at this hour?

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:44.370
I go to sIeep at night and get out of bed
in the morning, just Iike everyone eIse.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.270
No, that's not what
I meant.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.410
I'm out for a waIk, that's aII.
A waIk.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.070
WeII, see you!

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:01.390
She smeIIs of bIood...

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.320
Good morning, Sakura!

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.520
Oh, Miss Fujimura!
Good morning!

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.260
Isn't this a
great morning?

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.090
Days Iike this put you in the mood for
a bowI of morning rice grueI, doesn't it?

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.070
We shouId have some unused short-necked
cIams that were boiIed in soy sauce.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.830
Oo! In soy sauce?

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.240
I'II add starch to some heavy
broth to thicken it.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.870
Yay! I feeI the tension rising in me,
and it's stiII onIy morning!

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.880
Reservation for seconds!

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.150
I've searched most
of the mansion...

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:48.230
AII that's Ieft is...
Over there!

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:55.730
- Free of WorIdIy Thoughts
- SeIfIess Devotion to Justice

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.870
I see that you are
up and around.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.710
Yeah, I woke up
a few minutes ago.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.690
You don't Iook weII.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.650
I-It's nothing!
I'm fine now.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.690
Ah, I see.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:53.020
In that case, I wouId Iike to say something
regarding what happened Iast night, Shirou.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:54.490
What?

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.670
I wouId rather that my Master
not do what you did.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:04.340
Combat is my area of expertise, so pIease
focus excIusiveIy on your own duties.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.640
As my Master, you have no need to try to
protect me, and sureIy you have no reason to.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.710
I need a reason to try
to rescue a girI?

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:21.690
Look, Iet me ask you one more time.
You want me to caII you ''Saber''?

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:26.760
Yes. As I have entered into a pact with you,
I am your Servant. I shaII be your bIade.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.200
To win the
HoIy GraiI Wars?

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:33.770
Shirou?

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:36.270
Forget it, it's nothing.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.340
But the thing is, Saber, your chances
of winning with me are pretty sIim.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.450
Are you saying that you
Iack the wiII to fight?

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.520
No, I intend to fight,
aII right.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.920
RegardIess of how I got here, I've decided
to fight in this war of theirs.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.320
It's just that...

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.660
It's just that we don't
stand a chance.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.200
If you have no chance of winning,
then I wiII give you one.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.530
I wiII use every means
that I have at my disposaI.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:05.060
That doesn't incIude attacking peopIe
to gain strength, does it?

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.130
That method is not one
that is open to me.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:13.570
To attack an unarmed person
wouId vioIate my oath as a knight.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.230
However, if my Master were to order me to
do so, I wouId have no choice but to obey.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.830
But the price you wouId pay for compeIIing me
wouId be one piece of the seaI on your hand.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.390
No, I wouId never
make you do that.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.270
I'm sorry.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:48.540
I've unknowingIy
insuIted you.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.980
No, pIease Iift
your head.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.820
It was I who misjudged your intentions
and jumped to concIusions.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.260
I don't have the sIightest idea
what's going on,

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.630
...but I guess we'II just muddIe
through and do aII that we can.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.770
Shirou...
Yes.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.270
Hunger is the enemy.
Let's go eat, Shirou.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.750
What's the matter,
Shirou?

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.550
It just occurred to me. Are you okay
with Japanese food for breakfast?

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.290
Yes. I wiII eat anything
that is put in front of me.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.130
Extravagance is
the enemy.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.230
Sounds Iike there's
a Iot of enemies...

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.310
That might be
the case.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:52.710
Yeah, Iots of unbeIievabIe things
keep happening around here,

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:55.610
...but there are some things
that I can beIieve.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.150
Saber isn't a
coId-bIooded kiIIer.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.820
She's...

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:24.270
Fukai fukai mori no naka
honoka kaoru itoshii...

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:36.690
...hibi no omokage sagashite mireba
fui ni anata ga warau.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:49.490
Furete mitakute te o nobashite mo
hakanaku chuu o matta no desu.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:59.670
Anata ni aitakute zutto
aitakute zutto omou.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:04.080
Nemurenu yoru o watari

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:11.350
Anata ga nokoshita hikari
to kage no naka ni...

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:19.890
...tsutsumarete naite iru...

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:31.670
...fukai fukai mori

Next Time

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.890
Fate Stay Night.
