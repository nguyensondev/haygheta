00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.690
How should we kill them, I wonder.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.570
I can feel the flow of power.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.570
Because of all the blood
he shared with me.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.530
Of course we're going to
slay them vindictively.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.120
Get down!

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.300
Did you decide how to kill them?

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.680
Vindictively, of course!

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.000
EPISODE 9:
TEMARI DEMON AND ARROW DEMON

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.270
You were right, Yahaba!

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.350
A building just appeared out of nowhere!

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.400
The handiwork of a Blood Demon Arts
wielder adept at hiding objects.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.700
And is the demon hunter
accompanied by a demon?

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.780
What's going on here?

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.040
Isn't this fun?

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.500
Still, I have to say, Susamaru...

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.960
Your way of doing things
is so immature.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.170
So careless.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.710
You splattered me!

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.470
You splattered my kimono with dust!

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.140
Oh, stop whining!

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.770
We found them right away
thanks to my temari, so who cares?

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.140
And now we can have tons of fun!

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.280
You've gone and splattered me again!

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.070
You're so uptight.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.740
Your kimono isn't the least bit soiled.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.660
And besides...

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.960
Found 'em! Found 'em!

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.170
A temari!

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.250
So, she caused all this damage

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.460
by throwing that temari?

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.180
That woman...

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.140
Is she one of Kibutsuji's minions?

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.190
Lady Tamayo!

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.950
Yushiro!

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.080
Dammit!

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.040
Nezuko!

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.330
Take the lady sleeping in the back room
somewhere safe outside!

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.090
It's too dangerous outside!

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.340
We have a basement, so take her there!

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.670
Understood!

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.010
Nezuko!

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.600
That's one down!

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.230
She's giving off a totally different scent
than any of the other demons!

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.400
Is it stronger?
It's a really thick scent!

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.730
It feels so heavy
once it enters my lungs!

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.750
The demon hunter
wearing hanafuda-like earrings...

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.710
It's you, isn't it?

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.420
So, I'm the one they're targeting?

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.130
Miss Tamayo!

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.550
Please find a place to hide!

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.920
I'm the one those demons are after!

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.720
Tanjiro, I want you to fight
without worrying about us.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.350
We'll be fine without your protection.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.390
Since we're demons.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.480
All right.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.270
It's all over for you now!

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.490
That temari will only swerve if I dodge it.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.920
Of the ten forms...

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.420
The fastest thrusting technique...

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.210
Total Concentration...

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.920
Water Breathing!

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.340
Seventh Form,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.470
Drop Ripple Thrust-curve!

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.730
Oh, so you thrust at the curve diagonally
to soften the temari's blow.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:19.940
But...

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.990
How can that temari
move around like that?

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.660
It swerved unnaturally

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.950
when it struck Yushiro, as well!

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.790
It's not like it's spinning
in any special way, and yet...

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.200
What is this?

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.960
Yushiro!

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.250
Yushiro!

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.770
La...

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.770
Lady Tamayo!

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.270
Didn't I tell you?

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.070
That we shouldn't get involved
with that demon hunter!

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.690
From the start!

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.490
My Blindfold technique
is still a work in progress!

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.780
I know you're well aware
of that yourself!

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.290
I may be able to conceal the presence
of buildings and people, their scent,

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.170
but it's not like I can mask
their very existence!

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.670
The greater our numbers,
the more traces we'll leave,

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.880
and the greater the odds
that Kibutsuji will discover us!

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.180
Those demons got this close to us,

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.890
yet there was no scent
until we came under attack!

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.350
That was Yushiro's Blood Demon Art, huh?

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.060
Anyone who ruins the time
I spend alone with you...

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.190
I despise such people!

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.940
I despise them with passion!

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.950
It's unforgivable!

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.120
Hey, he's babbling!

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.290
What fun this is!

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.160
What fun this is!

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.040
To be killed by me,
one of the Twelve Demon Moons...

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.550
You should be honored!

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.050
Twelve Demon Moons?

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.630
They serve directly under Kibutsuji!

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.560
She grew more arms!

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.360
Now then, let's keep playing!

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.400
Until morning comes!

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.660
Until you die!

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.630
If I were to cast my spell now,

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.920
it would affect Tanjiro, as well.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.260
And Yushiro needs time to prepare
to switch to attack mode.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.510
But if this goes on...

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.060
There it is again!

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.100
Even without hitting anything,
they changed trajectory!

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.400
If I go ahead and slash them,
it blunts the blow,

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.650
but then they hit me anyway!

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.660
Two different scents of blood.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.780
There are two demons!

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.000
Their scent tells me where they are!

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:24.960
But...

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.670
Miss Tamayo! Yushiro!

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.170
It's no good!

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.300
I don't have time to protect them!

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.180
We'll be healed soon enough!

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.680
So don't worry!

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.850
Hey! Moron demon hunter!

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.980
If you look at the arrows,
you can tell which direction they're going!

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.730
Dodge the arrows!

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.520
Arrows?

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.820
Seriously, you can't even see them?

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.360
I'm going to lend you
my sense of sight!

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.820
That should at least enable you
to behead that temari woman!

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:13.630
I can see now!

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.220
She was using these arrows to control...

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.970
...the trajectory of the temari!

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.520
Thanks, Yushiro!

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.680
I can see the arrows now, too!

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.020
Then, hurry up and defeat her!

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.310
Nezuko!

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:32.980
Nezuko, let's go outside!

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.190
Take care of the demon up in the tree!

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.200
I'm the one you want to take on!

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.540
The demon hunter
wearing hanafuda-like earrings...

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.130
No question.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.050
I'm going to bring
that head of yours to him.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.550
What fun this is!

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.560
Nezuko, how much longer?

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.830
They're gone!

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.410
Water Breathing...

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.130
Third Form, Flowing Dance!

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.300
Miss Tamayo!

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.810
Are these two demons
closely related to Kibutsuji?

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.480
Most likely.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.270
Then, I'm going to extract blood
from them for sure!

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.990
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.990
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.870
I have two favors to ask of you.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.590
One, permission to study
your sister's blood.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.510
Two, to retrieve
blood samples from demons

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.390
as closely related to Kibutsuji
as possible.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.390
By "demons closely related to Kibutsuji,"

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:33.640
I meant demons whose powers are more
on par with that of Kibutsuji himself.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.610
It won't be easy to extract blood
from such demons.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.490
Third Form, Flowing Dance!

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:48.660
Miss Tamayo!

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.160
Are these two demons
closely related to Kibutsuji?

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:53.830
Most likely.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.600
You think you're going to extract
blood from us?

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.060
I don't know what you're scheming,

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.900
but I won't allow you
to do anything to displease him!

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:24.110
If you think you can extract blood
from us Twelve Demon Moons,

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.030
then have at it!

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.780
Watch your back!

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.160
Don't let your guard down for a second!

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.000
If those two really are Twelve Demon Moons,

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.960
then they're undeniably more formidable
than any other demon you've killed until now!

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.090
Right! Understood!

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.210
Watch my back, don't let
my guard down for a second,

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.340
undeniably...

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:45.880
until now...

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.640
Right! I'll do my best!

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.760
Lady Tamayo!

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.680
Let's use those two as decoys
and escape!

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.890
I'm just kidding!

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.780
Don't stir up dust like that.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.530
So filthy!

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.840
She grew new arms
in such a short time!

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:29.180
She can regenerate way faster
than those Final Selection demons!

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.600
I'm going to bring
that head of yours to him.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.230
Nezuko!

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.240
Now then, why don't you both die at once?

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.410
Are you okay, Nezuko?

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.290
Hey, Demon Hunter!

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.670
You get rid of that arrow man first!

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.630
We'll take on the temari woman
with your sister!

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.260
Understood!

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.760
Nezuko, whatever you do,
don't push yourself too hard.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:25.900
I'm counting on you.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.190
I swear...

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.030
I'm going to extract their blood!

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.370
If it means the medicine will be perfected
even a minute sooner,

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.450
I'll gladly fight any demon!

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.370
I'll fight and win!

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.290
There it is!

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.540
Opening Thread!

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.420
What a grimy little urchin you are.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.300
You stay away from me!

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.800
The thread snapped!

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.240
This hurts! I mean this really...

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.870
It seriously hurts!

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:26.630
A move!

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.010
Unleash a move to blunt the attack!

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.800
Eighth Form,

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.260
Waterfall Basin!

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.410
He vanished?

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.540
You hurt Lady Tamayo!

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.880
I'll never forgive you for that!

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.090
Tamayo?

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.130
Hey, Susamaru, the one over there...

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.600
Wouldn't that be Tamayo the Fugitive?

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.390
What a great souvenir she'll make!

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.640
Is that right?

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:27.900
Idiot!

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.190
You mustn't kick it!

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.370
What fun this is!

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.160
What fun this is!

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.920
I like kemari, too!

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.130
Yahaba!

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.920
Will four heads be enough to take home?

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.340
No. We're taking two.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.090
The demon hunter and the fugitive.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.850
We have no use for the other two.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.470
Nezuko...

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.690
The bleeding isn't stopping instantly.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.770
She's recovering so slowly.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.820
This medicine will help heal your leg
right away, all right?

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.330
What should I do?

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.040
I can't lose no matter what!

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.090
But even if I can see the Opening Thread,
it won't be easy to slash him!

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.130
Any move would be pointless

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.010
unless I can land my blow
in the opening with pinpoint accuracy!

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.770
If I'm off by even a little,
the move won't be nearly as potent!

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.650
He'll only change the sword's direction
using his arrow skills!

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.650
And I hate to say it,

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.780
but those eyeballs
on his hands are creepy!

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.650
Though I hate to say it!

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.160
The speed of this arrow!

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.040
It's not going to disappear until it hits me!

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.170
And I can't slash it with my sword!

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.920
The instant the blade touches it,

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:19.510
I'll get blasted away
in the arrow's direction!

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.850
What should I do?

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.030
It's all going the way I want it to!

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.240
Your arm's going to get twisted right off!

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.630
So, you eluded it by spinning in the same
direction as the Kouketsu Arrow?

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.630
Damn monkey!

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.090
I can't take much more of his attacks!

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:02.800
I gotta strike back!

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.180
I gotta change the arrow's direction
without touching it directly!

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.430
It's about time for you to die!

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.400
Adapt your moves!

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.530
First, use the Sixth Form
to envelope the arrow!

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.110
Then use the footwork of the Third Form...

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.830
to close in on him!

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.580
Twist!

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.250
Envelope!

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.260
Twisting Whirlpool-Flowing Water!

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.510
My sword's so heavy!

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.180
But...

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:51.890
Second Form...

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.020
Modified!

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.480
Horizontal Water Wheel!

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:53.930
PREVIEW

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:53.930
RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.630
Those are some powerful demons!

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.090
Those temari-and-arrow combination attacks
are giving me so much trouble!

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.300
Are you okay, Nezuko?

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:57.690
Today, I have a Taisho secret for you
about those demons!

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.110
Those two, Yahaba and Susamaru,
met for the first time today.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:05.230
I hear that they became friends
chatting with each other on their way here.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.990
I can't believe how much in sync
they are when they only just met!

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:11.120
Well, we can't let them beat us!

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.740
Nezuko, let's practice our teamwork!

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:16.500
First Form!

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:18.750
Second Form!

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:21.500
Third Form!

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:26.960
Looking good, Nezuko!

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.720
Next, Episode 10, "Together Forever."

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.600
I'm leaving the temari woman to you!

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:35.140
Let's fight together!

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:40.060
TO BE CONTINUED
