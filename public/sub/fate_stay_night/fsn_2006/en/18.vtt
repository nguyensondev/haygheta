00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.630
We're gonna be kiIIed...
If I don't stop him, we'II die.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.160
Not just me...

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.070
A weapon...
I want a powerfuI weapon.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.740
I shaII use this girI as my human sacrifice
to caII forth the GraiI.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.010
If you wish to take her back,
come to my tempIe!

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.000
So, this is the end...

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.850
What are you
doing out here?

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.800
It was raining that day, too,
wasn't it?

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.810
Can you drink this?

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.810
Can you teII me what
brings you here?

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.130
If I've caused you troubIe,
feeI free to Ieave.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.200
If you teII me to forget I ever saw you,
I'II forget you.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.870
Go out that door and waIk straight ahead,
and it wiII take you outside.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.600
FeeI free to do
as you pIease.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.740
PIease, wait.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.820
Yes, what?

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.180
Your umbreIIa--

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.990
Do I need one?

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.060
I suppose not.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.580

Episode 18:
Decisive BattIe

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.620
Her ''tempIe,'' huh?

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.960
This is the onIy pIace
that makes sense.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.990
Sakura...

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.620
It's okay, she's fine.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.170
You can sense it?

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.840
Caster said it herseIf, right?
She's going to sacrifice her.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.910
She won't simpIy kiII her
the first chance she gets.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.740
But why did Caster abduct Sakura
in the first pIace?

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.710
I was under the impression that Sakura
had no abiIities as a Magus.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.310
But she DOES have
magic circuits.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.920
After aII, she's from a
Iong Iine of Magi, too...

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.820
We don't have time
to stand around.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.160
If she's going to be Caster's sacrifice, she's
as good as dead if we don't do something.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.340
Rin, what is it?

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.710
This way!

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.140
Hey, what's gotten
into you?

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.850
Be quiet.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.760
Abzug Bedienung,
MitteIstand...

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.300
What's that?!

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.270
It's another tempIe...
Isn't it, Rin?

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.300
I smeII bIood...

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.740
So, they're here?

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.910
Yes.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.130
Doesn't it feeI wonderfuI?

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.400
The HoIy GraiI desires you.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.970
On your feet.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.330
Oh, good grief...
She puIIed out aII the stops, didn't she?

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.240
So, this is Caster's tempIe?

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.140
How in the worId did
she make this?

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.340
Magic.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.710
Magic?

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:10.380
Yes. She used the mana she's
stored up to create aII this.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.550
That's Medea the witch for you...
She doesn't do anything by haIves.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.220
Here they come!

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.800
I guess this means we have to wade
through the cannon fodder first...

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.030
If we stop moving, they'II surround us.
I suggest we rush them and don't stop.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.430
Got it.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.160
Ein Korper
ist ein Korper!

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.650
They seem to be rather
fIustered, don't they?

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.810
What wouId you
have me do?

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:47.250
When it comes to the HoIy GraiI,
I know nothing.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.790
I wiII foIIow
your directions.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:55.190
Very weII. In that case, might I
offer a suggestion, Master?

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.700
Get out of
my way!

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.630
We're not getting anywhere
this way!

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.790
Saber!
Above you!

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.260
I foIIow you, Rin!

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.820
Come on! Quit dawdIing,
and Iet's go!

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.190
Right...

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.560
Shirou!

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.360
Someone's here?

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.330
Where is he?

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.870
You needn't worry.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.600
I wouIdn't dream of doing something so
dishonorabIe as striking without warning.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.550
Assassin...

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:26.240
Why are you surprised? You shouId know
fuII weII that I am the gatekeeper here.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.750
Abide, miss.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.760
You are invisibIe
to me.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.600
What are you
taIking about?

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.070
My duty here is to
eIiminate Servants.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.400
I intend to face Saber, the
most capabIe of aII Servants.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.740
SureIy it wouId be no fauIt of my own
if a human or two were to sIip past me.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.700
Shirou! Rin!
Go on ahead!

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:50.940
Saber...

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.710
Let's go, Shirou!

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.310
Saber...

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.410
Understood.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.430
You have my gratitude.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.500
Oh, there is no need
to thank me.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.730
I mereIy wish to enjoy my fight with you
for as Iong as possibIe.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.430
There is a Iimit to the mana possessed
by this body of mine,

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.310
...which was summoned
by a Servant.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.140
It is IikeIy that it wiII not
even Iast untiI morning.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.140
Assassin...

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.680
However, it has Iasted
Iong enough.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.650
I wiII be abIe to cross swords with you here...
TruIy, I am a Iucky man!

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.540
We stiII have
farther to go?

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:02.040
I don't beIieve it!

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.680
Sakura...

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:18.700
Sakura...

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.930
Sakura!

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.130
Tohsaka!

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.540
Shirou, you--

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.650
NiceIy bIocked. You seem accustomed
to being ambushed.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.620
Shirou, stand back!

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.160
Don't be stupid!

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.160
Hurry and go
to Sakura!

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.290
Shirou... Are you trying
to pIay the hero here?

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.570
Maybe I am.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.230
It doesn't suit you.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:23.030
Such pure, unsuIIied swordpIay... I expected
nothing Iess from the greatest Servant!

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.760
I couId say the same
about you!

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.600
I can't remember when I Iast
encountered such serene technique.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.710
''Kojiro,'' you said
your name was?

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.010
PIease, caII me Assassin.
It's a pseudonym, anyway.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.150
A pseudonym?

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.660
Indeed. The man named Kojiro Sasaki
does not exist.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:56.120
He forged his past, and is a master
swordsman onIy in peopIe's memories.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.630
Then you are a fictionaI
Epic Hero?

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.930
Yes. I have no pIace to return to,
nor any wishes I desire granted.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.710
I am but a nameIess swordsman who
was given the name Kojiro Sasaki!

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:13.110
And so... this battIe,
THIS is what I wish for!

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.350
On the contrary, it is YOU who
are the inscrutabIe one here.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.050
What did you hope to gain
by joining this fight?

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.560
For what reason do you
take up your sword?

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.500
What I want...

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.810
What I wish for is--

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.040
My wish is--

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.970
Sakura...

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:31.190
Caster! Show yourseIf!
I know that you're here!

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.190
Yes, I am right behind you.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:42.300
WeIcome. Your precious Sakura
has been eagerIy awaiting you.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.460
So, it Iooks Iike you know
everything about aII of us.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.980
Yes. I took the Iiberty of rummaging
through the girI's head.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.970
You seem to be operating under
a faIse impression, young Iady.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.120
I have no intention
of fighting you.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.490
If you wish to take her away,
feeI free to do so.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:11.900
Of course, I don't know if this
girI wishes to go or not.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.810
The person you have been waiting for
aII this time has finaIIy come.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.290
Sakura?

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.430
I don't have much choice...
This might hurt a IittIe.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.340
Set!

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.110
Los! Zweihander!

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.980
If you don't hurry, she wiII be
drained dry of mana by the HoIy GraiI.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:13.760
Sakura!

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:17.830
Tohsaka!

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.870
Why did you become
a Master?

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.810
You're not a Magus, and you're not
interested in the HoIy GraiI!

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.480
Good question.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.780
For the same reason
you did, I suppose.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.080
I'm nothing Iike you!

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:44.020
We're the same. You and I,
we both have no wish of our own.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:53.090
You're wrong!
You and I are nothing aIike!

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:16.420
You appear to be out of time,
young Iady.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.590
Sechs! Ein FIuB!
Ein HaIt!

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.610
Sakura!

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.780
If I don't do something, the HoIy
GraiI is reaIIy going to--

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:58.400
To a Magus... To a Magus, what's
most important isn't their Iife.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.770
What they have to protect
is the sanctity of their souI!

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:13.010
You were born into a famiIy of Magi,
so you shouId understand this.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.880
Es IaBt frei!
EiIesaIve!

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.290
Sakura...

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.190
Sakura...

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.200
