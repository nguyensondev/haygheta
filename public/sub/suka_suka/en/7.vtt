00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.940
Welcome back!

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.530
Chtholly?

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.420
I'm h...

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.990
Jerk.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:38.260
WorldEnd:
What do you do at the end of the world?
Are you busy?
Will you save us?

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.320
A man who can tune dug weapons?

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.460
O-Oh, no...

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.170
I wasn't rebuking you.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.900
I just have a naturally menacing look.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.010
But talk about a tall tale.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.860
There once was a monster who could
tune them, but he's long gone.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.960
Is he in this room?

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.270
Yes. What will you do, Great Sage?

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.820
If you've brought him here,
then so be it.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.280
Let me see this con man for myself.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.080
Oh, is that you, Souwong?

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.280
Long time no see.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.100
Man, you've really changed.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.250
Black Agate Swordmaster?!

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.670
It's been ages since anyone's
called me that,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.410
Magus of the Pole Star.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.680
Aren't you happy that
we both seem well?!

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.640
You spent five hundred years
petrified on the surface?

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.610
I assumed you were dead because my
pulse tracing never got any response.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.230
Well, I was petrified.
My heart wasn't beating—

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.940
Give me back the tears I shed that day!

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.070
Oh, you cried for me?

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.360
U-Uh, no! I did not!

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.350
Why would I waste time crying
for the likes of you?

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.390
Hmm? Anyway,

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.410
why are you still alive?

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.000
Five hundred years have passed, right?

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:16.780
You...

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.770
What is that?

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.780
Back then, I was also killed in the battle.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.600
Along with Emissa.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.480
But just before I died, I placed a curse
on myself and altered my life force.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.440
So I can't be called human anymore.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.150
And I won't die of injury or old age.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.410
I see.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.520
Just so you know, I don't need your pity.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.340
I quite like my current life.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.910
Actually...

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.030
I'm more shocked by Emissa getting
done in than by your story.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.450
Hey...

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.160
Look at them go...

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.390
Is that Emissa?

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.560
Nah, it's probably Hillgram.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.950
I saw some gaping ridge
lines on the way here.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.980
Jeez, this party is full of monsters.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.140
You aren't much better yourself,
Black Agate Swordmaster.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.070
How many times must I tell you
not to call me that, Souwong?

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.490
Also, you should quit wearing that
dumb white cape already.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.620
But hey...

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.210
He's so tiny, he'd be hard
to spot without it.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.180
It is lame as hell, though.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.110
It does indeed suit the great Magus
of the Pole Star very well.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.730
You two really know how to
get on a person's nerves!

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.400
Well, eat this and calm down.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.850
One of Almaria's special ginger cookies.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.760
Almaria baked them for me?

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.710
For me?

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.810
Huh? No...

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.920
Ow...

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.190
Man...

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.610
What am I gonna do with you guys?

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.920
Until I took this job,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.650
I wasn't stable enough to even
reminisce about the past.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.120
That's it!

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.700
What do we do now?

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.540
You're the only one who
can tune carillons,

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.310
so you're perfect for the fairy
warehouse caretaker job.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.300
That said, I don't know if I should
really leave you there to rot.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.470
Sorry to interrupt your brainstorming,
but hurry and decide what you're doing.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.430
I promised to head back right away.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.530
Head back?

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.790
Where? To the fairy warehouse?

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:36.480
Yeah.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.770
While I'd love to stay and chat,
I'm glad to know we're both doing well.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.400
No, wait.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.610
Before you go, I want you
to meet someone.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.790
Huh?

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.950
You probably never wanted to
see them ever again, though...

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.660
Don't tell me, another of
our friends survived?

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.400
We're heading for Island 2!

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.540
Ready an airship immediately!

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.130
Hang on... I never said I'd go!

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.130
Hey, Souwong!

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.760
Room without an exit.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.190
Black cat that doesn't stop meowing.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.040
Dazzling gray sky.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.600
Unfamiliar blue-eyed girl.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.160
What a weird dream...

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.240
Come back already.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.460
She's probably really mad at me right now.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.920
Holy Grounds, Sky Island 2

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.580
This feels very much like the
temple of an evil clan.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.390
Despite knowing you forever,
I will never understand your tastes.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.890
Look who's talking.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.620
Five hundred years have passed, but your
love of white capes hasn't been cured yet.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.150
Don't make it sound like a disease!

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.130
This is part of my very heart and soul!

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.680
I would never cast it aside,
not in a thousand years!

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.170
Thanks, man.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.990
Where did that come from?
Why would you thank me?

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.140
Just felt like it.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.450
Don't worry about it.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.660
S-S-Stop that. Why are you grinning?

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.660
Gross.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.590
Out on a walk, are we?
Well, it is a pleasant day.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.130
You wanted me to meet her?

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.800
No, the other one down there.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.580
Hey, you oversized piece
of trash, I'm here.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.030
Oh, if it isn't the Great Sage.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.690
Perfect timing. I was pretty bored.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.650
I've brought someone I'd like you to meet,

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.600
Eboncandle!

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.870
It's you! That, uh... What was it?

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.970
You know, the guy from back then.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.710
Hey, Souwong...

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.480
Please tell me this is all a bad dream.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.710
Want me to slap you so you can make sure?

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.740
I think I'll pass.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.300
It's been eons, human brave.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.190
I never thought the day would come
when our paths would cross again.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.640
But sadly, we are fated to
always cross swords.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.320
We cannot avoid walking
down this bloody path.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.990
Look, you can give that a rest.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.330
Really? How boring...

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.460
Why do you look like that, anyway?

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.330
The Eboncandle I fought in
the past had skin, flesh,

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.210
and an actual body from the neck down.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.170
You're the one who burned
my body to a crisp!

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:57.200
Can you imagine how shocked
I was to wake in this state?!

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.270
And I've had to keep using
my powers ever since, too.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.660
I haven't had the chance to heal myself.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.000
I see now.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.060
So the paradise in the sky

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.970
was built by you two.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.160
That is correct.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.800
In order to escape the seventeen beasts,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.880
I used brute force to elevate
some land into the sky.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.280
And somehow, it has lasted
for five hundred years.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.230
Eight-tenths of it is thanks
to my powers.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.870
What are the seventeen beasts, anyway?

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.600
What the hell happened to cause
their appearance? And where?

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.670
They are humanity's sin.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.110
To begin with, ancient—

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.300
Remember True World?

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.640
Oh, yeah. I remember them.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.030
Some old, armed cult that
we took out, right?

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.920
Yeah.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:50.600
The beasts are biological weapons
born as a result of their failed research.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.280
I see.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.240
So that's why the people here say that
emnetwihts destroyed the surface.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.200
That's right.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.620
Humans did destroy the surface.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.320
Don't you want to take it back?

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:12.960
You're an annoying guy with a rotten
character, personality, heart, and soul.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.120
But you have top-notch, reliable skills.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.680
You are worthy to be a part of our plan...

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.440
No, you're indispensable for it.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.680
Oh?

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.210
Isn't the surface done for, though?

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.980
Isn't it a danger zone
with beasts everywhere?

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.190
What are you planning?

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.190
We'll attack them ourselves.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:38.740
With you, we can again use the carillons
that couldn't be tuned or wielded.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.490
This is significant progress.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.400
The battle will probably require all the
resources from every Règles Aile city.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.650
It will be a long road, fraught with danger.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.210
However, we stand a good
chance of coming out on top.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.670
We can procure as many
fairies as we need.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.670
Our only problem was the
shortage of usable carillons.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:59.260
Oh?

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.640
Uh, forget what I just said...

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.600
You messed up.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.670
We are the special weapons
that you mentioned.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.940
So you guys are the ones producing them.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.890
Attention, all operatives.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.500
Hurry up!

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.660
Unknown beast detected.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.380
Island 15 will hereby be abandoned.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.500
Strategic HQ is to fall back to Island 16.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.950
Hardcover picture book.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.820
Warm melody.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.840
Black and white zigzag.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.920
Swaying boat.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.060
Damaged cocoon.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.140
Red water.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.510
Ashen wind.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.120
Seven-eyed frog.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.760
Endless orange road.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.440
Fabric with a silver glint.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.510
What? What the hell is this?!

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.190
Quiet! Shut up!

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.900
Get out of my head!

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.910
Chtholly...

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.740
...sed.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.380
I will go back.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.250
I promised...

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.670
I promised.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.130
I promised!

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:24.800
They're swords that use the enemy's force
against them when it hits the blade.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.560
Lion eating a snake.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:31.560
Round rainbow.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.600
Pile of gold coins.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.330
Tiny bowl filled with sweets.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.630
Burning signpost.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.080
Fish flying between the stars.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.020
Shut up!

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.320
No matter what,

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.300
I will go back!

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.860
I have to go back...

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.260
Go back to...

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.290
Go back to him.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.720
Those fairies are borderline unstable ghosts.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.980
Souls of children who, not realizing
they're dead, wander into our world.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.860
They aren't even life forms.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:27.820
One of my necromancy skills allows
me to produce fairies from wandering spirits.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.920
Since they don't fear death,

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.250
they're ideal, mass-produced weapons
that can cause venenum explosions.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.920
They have very short lifespans.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.410
And if they generate too much
venenum in combat,

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:44.420
memories of their past lives can eat
into them, causing mental disintegration.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:50.350
But we're trying to protect the world here.
They're sacrifices that can be overlooked.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.470
You three really overslept today.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.360
Well, yeah. The battle was totally awful...

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.080
Dead.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.900
We'd like to take it easy for a while.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.400
Right, Chtholly?

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.070
Chtholly?

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.410
Yes, it seems you are still worn out.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.270
On that note, excuse us
from chores for the time being.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.650
No can do!

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.380
Sorry.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.250
I think I'll get some more sleep.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.160
Flat spider.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.810
Used-up candles and burned envelopes.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:45.690
Be quiet.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.740
Half-eaten cookie.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.950
Metal bird and
rainbow-colored arrowhead.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.550
Vivid mine.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.090
Stomach with a thorn.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.700
Giraffe bending toward the water.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.280
Shut up.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.700
Shut up.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.200
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut your damned mouth!

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.410
We made a promise.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.660
Will I... not make it?

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:13.030
Man, I really wanted to eat that butter cake.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.600
Threads made of morning dew.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.560
Breaking world.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.420
Father.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.980
Yellow plushie.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.390
Shining skylark nest.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.020
Pebble in a paper packet.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.020
Carnival in the water.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.020
Black cat that doesn't stop meowing.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.020
black cat that doesn't stop meowing

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:22.770
Dazzling gray sky.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:22.770
dazzling gray sky

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.020
kiss of a golden butterfly

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.330
Kiss of a golden butterfly.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:24.980
and then

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:26.270
And then?

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.360
And then...

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.620
And then...

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.860
I... I...

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.780
Who am I?

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:58.480
It's a fact that the fairies are the
only way to use the carillons.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.290
Sure, defense is one thing.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.280
But don't discard their lives
for some imperialistic urge!

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.880
The world heads steadily toward ruin.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.680
Who knows how long Règles Aile will last?

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.670
And we must return to the
surface someday, as well.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.910
But no one knows, or cares, about it.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.240
For everyone living out there now,

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.200
Règles Aile is their home!

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.960
Not anywhere else!

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.500
Am I wrong?!

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.160
But don't you hate this?

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.310
Don't you want to go back?

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.500
Souwong,

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.510
even if we do retake the surface,
who will we find?

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.400
Do we have any family who will
welcome us back there?

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.920
Great Sage, give it up for now.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.110
He is a resolute man.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:55.930
Once he decides to protect something,

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.530
he'll protect it, even if it means
sacrificing everything else.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:06.440
You care more about fairies who will
soon die than this world's future?

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.370
Yeah.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.960
Right now, I just want to hurry
up and get back to them.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.890
Is that the choice you've made,
Willem Kmetsch?

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.000
That's right.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.770
I always thought you were a
bit more of a heroic brave.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.730
Same here.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.150
I'm here to make an urgent report.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.080
It's about the wielder of
dug weapon Seniorious.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.180
Memories of her past life

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.610
have started to disintegrate her mind.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.130
There he goes...

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:49.130
Why didn't you tell him the
truth about the beasts?

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.800
I used to look up to him
as an older brother.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:58.760
I don't want him to hate me any more.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.340
No, it's mine!

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.680
No, I took it first!

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.920
Hey, do you know where Nygglatho is?

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.810
She's up in the mountains!

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.280
Hey, give it back!

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.630
Whenever someone doesn't return,
she goes to the mountains to fight bears.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.890
Oh...

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.620
Then I guess we'll have stewed
bear for dinner tonight.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.320
What's wrong, Tiat?

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.990
You seem kinda gloomy.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.800
I don't know.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.040
It feels like there's a big hole in my head.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.500
Why? Because Chtholly broke?

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.540
Maybe.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.610
She kept her promise, you know.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.620
She wasn't supposed to
return from that battle.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.120
But because she wanted to see you
and have you baby her again,

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.860
she did everything to return
with a little bit of time left.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:57.590
Yeah, she kept her promise.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.230
But I didn't say what she wanted to hear.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:02.320
Or do what she wanted.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:04.520
I did nothing for her.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.010
Chtholly!

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.400
Are you looking for something?

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.480
Jade... Ebo.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.300
Jadeebo?

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.040
I see.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.970
Hey, what's your name?

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.060
Elq!

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.500
Elq, huh?

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:15.380
I hope you find Jadeebo.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.550
I'll help you look.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.970
I mean, this place seems huge.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.180
Me?

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.410
My name is...

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:29.880
Huh?

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.710
Who am I, again?

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:35.980
I don't know.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.990
But I think there was something important...

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.050
That's right. I have to go back.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.280
No matter what?

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.350
No matter what.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.310
Even though it'll only
bring you lots of pain?

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.680
Well, yeah.

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.770
But I have a promise to keep.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.610
Oh...

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.920
see you, chtholly.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:22.960
It's rare that I see you drinking
anything other than tea.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.390
I'm glad you're here.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.590
I'm sick and tired of crying alone.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:34.620
In the past, I wanted to fix things
that couldn't be fixed,

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.740
like the tragedies or unhappiness
people went through.

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.760
But I was always too powerless.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.380
In the end, I couldn't do anything at all.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:51.430
I thought I'd learned my lesson
over and over by now.

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.290
But I wanted to make Chtholly happy.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.350
Seriously,

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.270
what did she ever see in me?

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.040
How do you not know the answer to that?

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:22.600
I mean, you gave me so many firsts.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.640
At that market, you became
the first to help me.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.700
You were the first to take me
somewhere with a great view.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.420
You were the first to inspire many
different emotions in me.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.510
You were the first person
to let me lean on them.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.810
And you were the first opponent I lost to.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.590
Man, I can't keep count.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:49.300
So it's obvious that you'd be
the first person I ever fell in love with.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.010
Take a hint, dummy.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.510
What happened to me, anyway?

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.420
I remember getting to the warehouse
and having a weird dream.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.900
And you just wouldn't come back...

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.280
What's with that look?

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.660
Welcome home, Chtholly...

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:31.820
Welcome home.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.890
A miracle of love?

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:53.080
I don't know about love,

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.410
but this is definitely a miracle.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.900
Knowing her, though,

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:03.440
she probably ignored the consequences
and paid a huge price to make it happen.
