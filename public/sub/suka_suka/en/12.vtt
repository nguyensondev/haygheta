00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.780
We vowed to be together forever.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.110
And that vow brought me happiness.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.640
I realized how much I loved him.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.540
And that realization brought me happiness.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.210
He told me he would make me happy.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.550
And those words brought me happiness.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.310
He brought an incredible amount of
happiness and joy into my life.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.810
Which is why I can say for certain,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.150
and no one can convince me otherwise,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.130
that I am the happiest girl
in the world right now.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.540
Island 28

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.290
Town of Grimbjhal

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.450
Careful, ironmonger!
You could hurt someone!

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.830
It wasn't me!

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.410
Oh, for crying out loud!

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.770
Hold it!

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.890
I've got you now!

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.710
Hey... It's not safe! Get of—

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.760
I can't generate the venenum in time!

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.400
Ow...

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.090
I'm sorry!

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.070
Are you hurt?

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.940
Are your organs intact?

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.320
Get back here!

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.780
Hey, Mom...

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.540
Don't stare at her.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.440
Hey, is she...

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.420
Why is someone without
any fur on this island?

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.420
She's disfeatured.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.010
Oh, my hat...

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.340
Get out of here!

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.270
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.340
Get out, filthy disfeatured!

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.730
I know, I know.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.210
Wait.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.940
Let go! I'm—

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.640
Just wait a second.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.170
That little cat had it in its mouth.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.350
It's yours, right?

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.070
Thank you.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.920
Are you all right?

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.140
Yeah...

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.240
Are you new here?

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.160
Yes.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.780
Oh, jeez.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.800
Hey, even he's...

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.370
Yeah, look.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.050
What's going on?

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.700
Come on. This way.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.290
That should do it.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.530
Uh, are you—

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.950
This island has no good food
or local specialties.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:31.440
Um...

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.890
And it doesn't welcome those
of us who lack fangs or horns.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.650
Not exactly a tourist destination.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.490
I know that.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.940
Come with me.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.160
You've had it with this place, right?

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.490
If you wanna leave,
I'll walk you to the port.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.740
Hey!

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.290
Thank you for all your help.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.750
And I'm sorry for all the
trouble I've caused you.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.740
And, uh...

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.970
While I know I have no right
to ask this of you, um...

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.800
Someplace you wanna visit?

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.200
This view is what you wanted to see?

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.000
Yeah.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.480
I've seen sky islands from
higher up and farther out.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.310
But I've never gazed down on
one from the heart of town.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.890
So I've always wanted to do this once.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:59.690
That so?

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.630
Yeah.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.300
I've gotten my wish, along with
some good memories.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.320
I can go without regrets now.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.780
Thank you so much for today!

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.490
I had many wonderful experiences.
And you made them all possible.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.690
You're giving me too much credit.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:17.780
I'm not.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.290
Are they here for you?

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.510
I felt like I was in a fairytale,
but time's up.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.930
Mind if I make one last request?

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.720
I'd really like it if you could
forget you ever met me.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:39.940
What the heck?

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.920
Goodbye.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.900
Well, I have no right to poke
my nose into her business.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.240
Long time no see, Grick.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.800
Is Anara doing all right?

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.250
He screwed up last month
and became Third food.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.820
Uh, sorry about that.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.800
No worries. We're salvagers.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.940
The moment we chose to treasure hunt
on the surface, we were ready to die.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.470
Right.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.060
Seriously, don't let it bother you.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.310
Anyway, I might be able to land you a job.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.890
It's for the military.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.230
Oh, come on!

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.600
Try to hide your displeasure a little!

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.430
This job requires no special
skills or experience.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.720
They only seek someone trustworthy.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:34.950
Nope.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.200
Sorry, but I'll pass. Ask someone else.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.620
They'd also prefer a disfeatured,
with no fur or horns.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.480
Where will I find someone
else who fits so perfectly?

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:44.960
Come on...

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.940
I appreciate your looking out for me.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.240
But I live here of my own free will.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.330
I get it.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.970
You wanna keep living as an outcast,
like a dead man walking, right?

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.940
I bet you can't bring yourself
to seek a happy life.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.840
It's not like I don't get where you're
coming from, but even still,

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.980
I want you to live a normal life
up in these skies.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.000
The dead won't ever come back.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.530
I can accept that.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.410
But you're still alive, man!

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.760
Hey, just make a boatload
of cash on this job

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.830
and leave this debt-ridden lifestyle behind!

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.210
Find your path to walk in life.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.170
Isn't this coffee a bit salty?

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.660
Oh, damn it all. Fine!

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.700
You'll take it?!

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.960
And what am I supposed
to do in the military?

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.020
Let me remind you that I
can't fight or kill people.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.750
Don't worry.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.980
You'll be a caretaker of a warehouse
with some special weapons.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.190
This already sounds like bad news.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.450
Well, I'll let them know you're coming!

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.410
Get them to fill you in once you're there.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.870
Man, this coffee sure is salty...

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.830
Fringes of Sky Archipelago
Règles Aile, Island 68

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.770
The warehouse is on this island, huh?

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.510
Brr...

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.480
Oh, man. I really hope
I don't run into wolves.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.810
Right now, I'm just a frail,
powerless disfeatured.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:37.520
This bridge is practically falling apart...

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.570
Talk about being in the middle of nowhere!

00:10:58.920 --> 00:10:59.590
Wai—

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.270
Ow!

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.860
Hey, Pannibal! Don't just run off alone!

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.490
I've taken down a suspicious individual.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.150
Right... Like there's anyone here—

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:27.830
Aren't you...

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.420
Wh-What are you doing here?

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.130
I have a ton of questions—

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.840
But first, help me.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.840
Orlandry Merchant Guild, Warehouse #4

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.480
Something's wrong.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.160
It's nothing like what Grick said.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.770
I'll be out in a minute.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.730
It's been forever, Willem!

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.990
Welcome to the secret
weapons warehouse!

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.840
Huh? Have you grown a little taller?

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.410
Why are you here,

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:07.850
Nygglatho?

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.570
Why, you ask? Why wouldn't I be?

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.920
This is where I work!

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.460
That damn Grick set me up!

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.750
You two are still good friends, huh?

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.630
Too bad that friendship is over now.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.320
Keep it down when we're indoors.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.010
Everyone's in bed now.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:24.860
"Everyone"?

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.520
This warehouse is

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.520
run jointly by the Guardian Wings Military
and the Orlandry Merchant Guild.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.980
So, at least on paper, it needs
caretakers from both parties.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.520
I represent the guild here.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.980
And you're the military caretaker.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.480
I heard about that.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.650
That uniform looks lovely on you.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.040
I feel I'm gonna choke in it.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.720
Oh, don't rain on my parade.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.480
Toppings really accentuate
the flavor of a dish.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.310
Right now, you look about twice
as appetizing as before.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.710
Then, my life is in twice the danger.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.190
Oh, ye of little faith.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.740
Remember what I said?

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.720
While I may be a troll, and you are an
extremely rare feast in my eyes,

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.120
I have no plans to dig in yet.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.240
Really, now?

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.030
I mean, it'd be such a shame...

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.450
You're the last of your kind.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:20.200
I know not to waste you on a
passing burst of appetite.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.120
Of course, if you say I can
eat you, I shall consider it.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.640
May I eat you?

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.470
Hell, no.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.530
Really? Won't you change your mind?

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.290
At least an arm...

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.830
No, even a finger will do.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.500
Quit it. Let's get down to business.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.920
So, what am I supposed to do here?

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.500
Nothing.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.840
Huh?

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.200
Uh, do you plan to stay on this island?

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.480
Well, obviously. How else will
I do my job as caretaker?

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.180
I became a military employee,
so I'm in for the long haul.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.190
But the two previous caretakers
didn't show up after the first day.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.300
Really?

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.660
What will you do?

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.160
If you say you can't stay here,

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.910
I'll gladly arrange accommodations
away from the island.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.360
And I won't get stabbed the moment
I take my eyes off you?

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.990
Wow, mean.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.290
What kind of monster do you take me for?

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.620
One that devours people.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.540
Anyway, I'm not into quitting
a job I've taken on.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.700
I fully intend to stay right here.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.370
I knew I could count on you!

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.340
Now, after so long, I get
to take care of you again.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.970
That makes me kind of happy.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.140
Don't get the wrong idea, Willem.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.940
This isn't about a man and
woman together and whatnot.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.180
She's just trying

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.660
to fatten a tasty-looking
lamb before she eats it.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.090
Why the scary look?

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:47.400
Just to confirm...

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.840
You really don't plan to eat me, right?

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.610
Right.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.930
Honestly, I simply wish
to take care of you.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:59.080
We trolls are bound by natural instinct
to serve our guests with dedication.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.080
I won't tell you to let me eat you yet,

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.400
so in return...

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.190
Help me sate my other instinct!

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.630
Back to the topic.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.880
This building is the weapon warehouse
I'm to look after, correct?

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.850
You meanie...

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.560
Well, that is correct.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.990
This looks nothing like it.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.650
Aren't we talking about
weapons like guns or artillery...

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.740
Let's continue the discussion tomorrow.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.240
It's gotten rather late,

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.570
and the naughty walls have ears.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:40.220
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.140
Hey, don't shove!

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.300
Hey, Nygglatho. Thanks for having us.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.540
Yeah, have us!

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.250
Get back to your rooms...

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:47.210
Uh, before that, we'd like to
greet the new caretaker.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.670
...or I'll eat you!

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.090
Goodnight.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.340
Goodnight.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.000
Let me show you to your room.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.560
Yeah, I really am allergic to you.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.040
Huh?

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.110
You meanie...

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.890
Jeez, such a lively place.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.920
Pops!

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.580
Pops?

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.160
Sheesh, Pops. How long
are you going to sleep?

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:25.930
Think he's asleep?

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.280
Don't ask me. I've never
seen a man before.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.210
We should probably keep it down.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:39.540
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.250
What? What? What's going on?

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.180
Hey, caretaker,

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.680
beautiful night, isn't it?

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.720
Have us!

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.160
Nygglatho will hear you.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:45.810
So, who are you girls?

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.600
Tiat!

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.600
Pannibal.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.600
Collon!

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.980
If you speak all at once,
he can't hear you!

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.020
I'm Lakhesh.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:51.780
I'm sorry.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.650
Collon,

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.650
Pannibal,

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:54.760
Tiat,

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.080
and Lakhesh.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.620
Okay, I've got all your names now.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.470
Where'd you come from?
What's your name?

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:04.510
What's your deal with Nygglatho?
Your conversation was really suggestive.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.870
What kind of food do you like?
And what can't you eat?

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.340
And of all these questions,

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.210
which will you answer first?

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.900
I guess I'll answer your question first.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.680
I like spicy meat dishes,

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.890
and I can't stand reptrace cuisine.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.100
Nygglatho and I are basically
farmer and lost lamb.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.530
Until this morning, I lived on Island 28.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.170
And the name's Willem.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:30.630
Willem Kmetsch.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.740
Looks like you'll be seeing
me around for a while.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.500
You mean you'll live here?

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.440
Probably.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:38.950
It's not that big a deal.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.420
Y-You see,

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:44.620
no military caretaker has
ever lived here before.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.840
Right, Nygglatho did say
something like that.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.210
Oh, come on.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.170
What are you girls doing?

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.490
Weren't you told to give him space?

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.270
Er, well...

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.750
Curiosity overwhelmed us!

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:58.670
Yeah, that's right.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.100
You could say it was out of our hands.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.810
Weren't you told?

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.100
Goodnight!

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.310
Later, Willem! See you tomorrow!

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.560
Those girls...

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.060
Sorry the little ones caused such a fuss.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.550
I don't mind.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.280
I'm used to dealing with kids.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.000
Or wait...

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.490
I was.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.840
Well, don't spoil them too much, okay?

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.530
It'll go right to their heads.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.550
I'll keep it in mind.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.980
A-Also,

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.080
I'm sorry Pannibal attacked you earlier.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.440
She didn't mean any harm.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.930
I'm not mad.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.890
You provided hot water immediately,
so I even avoided a cold.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.600
Um... And, well...

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.980
Chtholly.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.530
My name's Chtholly.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:02.190
Like, I know this is really belated,

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:05.210
but we didn't introduce
ourselves back in that town.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.740
Oh, yeah. I'm Willem.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.210
Pleased to meet you, Chtholly.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:10.950
Y-Yeah.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.210
Um... And...

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.500
Never mind. Sorry to disturb you.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.540
Goodnight.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.070
Oh, wait up...

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.890
I'd like to ask you something.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:31.190
I'm here as caretaker for some special
military weapons or something.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.850
Yes.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:35.760
And this is a warehouse that's
used to store those weapons.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.570
Correct.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.380
Then why does it look nothing
like a warehouse?

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.990
Why don't I see those
weapons anywhere?

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.370
Even if I put those questions on the
back burner, I have to ask...

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.720
Who are you girls?

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.290
Why are kids living in a military facility?

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.070
You came here without
even knowing that?

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.940
Yeah.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:01.130
And you played with those girls
without knowing anything?

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:01.800
Yeah.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.220
Are you, uh...

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.560
the type who just goes with the flow?

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.900
Oh, very well.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.440
I'll answer your questions.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.510
The answer to the first set of
questions lies in the second.

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.400
And the answer to the second
set lies in the first!

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.810
What do you mean?

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.410
You needn't overthink it.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.440
I mean exactly what I say.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.620
We are the special weapons
that you mentioned.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.080
We'll be in your hands starting tomorrow,

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.880
our caretaker!

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.800
526 Years Ago

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:14.220
Orphanage on the Outskirts of
Gomag City, Imperial Territory

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.810
Here you go.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.480
I've been waiting for this!

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.440
Time to eat!

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.150
Enjoy your meal.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.110
The night before the final battle...

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:26.920
Can't you find anything
good to say, Pops?

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.980
Like what?

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.020
Hmm...

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.330
"Once this war is over, I'll get married,"
or something?

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:35.290
Uh, I don't see that ending well at all.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:39.540
Because it's the kind of thing that
characters likely to die in a story say, right?

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.830
They get killed off first because
it's more dramatic.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.220
I get that reasoning. I really do.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.380
When characters you want to live
end up dying, it's sadder.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.180
But you know...

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:58.250
It must suck for those who get killed
off due to the creator's absurd reasoning.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:59.770
Well, yeah.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:06.020
So, Pops, since you're headed
to the final battle now,

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.740
hold on to something concrete!

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.740
A concrete reason to come back here.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.450
Anything will do.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.970
If not...

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:21.540
I'm not sure I'll be able to send
you off with a smile tomorrow...

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.390
Butter cake.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:27.920
Huh?

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.560
I like your butter cakes.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.440
Bake an extra-large one
for my next birthday.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.600
Huh? You'll fight to return
alive just for cake?

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.890
Something wrong with that?

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.420
No, it's just...

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.930
Fine, whatever.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:45.910
I'll settle for that.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:47.940
In return, since you suggested it,

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.900
I'll feed you enough cake
to give you heartburn.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.320
Within a year from that night,

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.480

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.810
And of course, the young quasi-brave
failed to fulfill his promise.
