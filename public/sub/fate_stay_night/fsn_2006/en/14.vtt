00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.020
Whosoever puIIs this sword
from the stone...

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.120
...shaII be the rightfuI king
of aII Britain.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.560
Arturia, before you take it, I suggest that
you consider the resuIt of your actions.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.770
Once you take that sword in hand, that is
the end. You wiII cease to be a human being.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.840
Saber chose to protect you
rather than herseIf.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.410
Never forget that.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.350
So, wiII you become my Servant?
That way, I won't have to kiII you.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.390
W-What did you say?

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.930
Einzbern CastIe...
You're sure that he's in here?

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.840
I swear, you've
Iost your mind.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.810
I take it that you haven't forgotten
what pawn she controIs?

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.160
It makes no difference what
might be waiting for me inside.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.990
To any Servant,
her Master is--

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.120
Quiet!

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.800
Archer, hide yourseIf!
Saber, you mask your presence, too.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.720
IIIyasvieI...

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.200
Must be my imagination.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.920
Shirou...

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:37.600
Yume ni mite ita, ano hi no kage ni
todokanai sakebi.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:50.910
Asu no jibun wa nante egaite mo
kienai negai ga nureru.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:03.890
Koboreochiru kakera o
tsukamu sono te de...

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:18.600
...yureru kokoro kakaete
tobikonde ike yoru e!

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:30.390
Dare ka no tami ni ikite
kono toki ga subete de ii deshou?

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:42.370
Misekake no jibun wa sotto sutete
tada ari no mama de.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.140
Episode 1 4:
The End of the IdeaI

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.420
AImost got it...

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.430
I have to warn Saber
and Tohsaka right away!

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.390
Damn it, a guard is
checking up on me NOW?

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.000
Stay where you are!

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.370
Shirou?

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.380
Saber?! What are YOU
doing here?

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.570
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.520
You're in better shape
than we expected.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.250
I suppose this means that we
didn't need to come here.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.850
As I recaII, that's what I toId you. I said
we shouId Ieave Shirou Emiya to his fate.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.760
Tohsaka and Archer?
What are you two doing here?

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.500
I asked them for their assistance. It Iooked
Iike you had been abducted by IIIyasvieI.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.640
After aII, we're more
or Iess partners.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.500
Come on, Iet's get out of here
before IIIyasvieI gets back.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.250
Saber!

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.900
I am aII right...

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.260
I knew it, Saber,
you haven't recovered yet.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.330
Yes, aIthough it shames
me to admit it...

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.200
Even so, I can at Ieast
provide cover for you.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.500
Don't be stupid.
Come on, you can Iean on me.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.280
That won't be necessary.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.370
Saber!

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.840
Leave her be.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.010
What?

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.820
Don't get it into your head
to try to heIp Saber.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.510
When it's aII said and done, there's
absoIuteIy nothing that you can do.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:44.880
Come again?

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.200
Shirou, Iet's go.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.540
Right.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.090
That's the--

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.050
The exit. Looks Iike
we made it in time.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.590
The exit? This is the
front entrance to the castIe!

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.060
Isn't this the most obvious way to go?
Or the most baIIsy...

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.770
The enemy's away, so our best bet is to make
a break for it using the shortest route, right?

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.370
AII right, here goes...

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.580
Goodness, you're Ieaving aIready?
What a shame, you just got here.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.630
IIIyasvieI...

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.100
Good evening. I'm gIad that you came here
and saved me the troubIe of finding you, Rin.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.630
What's the matter?
It's no fun if you don't say anything.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.010
I'm giving you a IittIe time, so you reaIIy
ought to come up with some Iast words.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.210
AII right, Iet me ask
you something, then.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:19.250
Tohsaka?

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.810
IIIyasvieI, I didn't sense
you coming back inside.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.260
You weren't hiding here
the whoIe time, were you?

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.860
That's right. I didn't
go anywhere.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.760
I was just watching you peopIe
run around Iike fooIs.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.730
So, it was a fake that
went outside, then.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.910
That's right. I'm the Iady of the castIe,
so I have to see to my guests' needs...

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.710
...and keep them company!

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.770
Have you said aII that
you wanted to say?

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.600
It Iooks that way.
AII right, then, Iet's get started.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.270
I give you my word. I won't
Iet any of you escape today.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.280
Shirou, I want you to run.
Leave this to me, and--

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.290
What're you taIking about?
You know I can't do that!

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.380
But I...

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.720
Archer, can you hear me?

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.490
It doesn't have to be for Iong, but I
need you to sIow him down by yourseIf.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.790
Tohsaka!

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.790
Preposterous...
Have you Iost your mind, Rin?

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.490
Archer can't possibIy
take on Berserker by himseIf.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.330
We'II escape whiIe you keep him occupied.
AII right?

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.400
That's the wisest
course of action.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.010
If you escape first, Rin,
I'II be abIe to escape, too.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.070
Besides, independent operations
such as this...

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.550
...are the speciaIty
of the archer cIass.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.010
I'm amazed.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:05.090
You seriousIy think that your no-name
Servant is going to stop my HercuIes.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.090
You're a Iot more amusing than
I gave you credit for, Rin.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.100
By the way, Rin, do you mind if I asked
you something just so I'm cIear on this?

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.040
I can buy you time
if that's aII you want,

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.100
...but you wouIdn't have a probIem with it if
I went ahead and destroyed that thing, right?

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.980
Archer...

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.250
No, don't hoId back
if you don't want to.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.290
In that case, I hope to Iive up
to your expectations.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.780
Rip that insoIent fooI Iimb from Iimb
if you want! KiII him, Berserker!

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.100
Shirou! Saber!
Let's go!

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.200
But he--

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.910
Shirou, this is
the onIy way.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:59.740
Shirou Emiya.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:06.480
Listen cIoseIy. You aren't someone who fights,
you're onIy someone who creates.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.620
Push everything eIse
from your mind.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.920
There is onIy one thing that you are
capabIe of, so try to master that one thing.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.290
Archer...

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:27.470
Never forget, what you shouId aIways be
visuaIizing is yourseIf at your most powerfuI.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.480
You don't need externaI enemies.
For you, your own worst enemy...

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.980
...is the image you have of
yourseIf in your head.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.250
Shirou!

00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.440
Archer...

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.750
Which way?!

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:17.760
This way!

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.950
Archer...

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.860
I dodged his every strike,
and this happens?

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.290
That's the way, Berserker!
Hurry up and crush him!

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.880
How weak... They broke down
aImost as soon as you caIIed them up?

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.490
You reaIIy thought you couId fight Berserker
with a NobIe Phantasm Iike that?

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.550
Berserker!

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.930
So, I guess he reaIIy is as
tough as the rumors say...

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.430
Why is he smiIing?

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.610
I am the bone
of my sword...

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.040
What was that noise?

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.500
It was probabIy
Archer using his--

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.380
Let's move.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.710
Tohsaka!

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:01.380
We have to escape,
no matter what.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:15.200
I can't beIieve it, he put Berserker
on the defensive...

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.630
Who in the worId IS he?
He actuaIIy Projected a NobIe Phantasm...?

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.710
That wouId've instantIy kiIIed
any normaI Servant.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.890
Berserker!
Go after him!

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.580
He's awfuIIy nimbIe
for someone his size.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.760
SteeI is my body,
and fire is my bIood...

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.400
I have created over
a thousand bIades...

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:39.910
What?

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.110
Unknown to death,

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.490
...nor known to Iife.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:58.000
Power, uproot the mountains!
BIades, part the waters!

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.900
Did I mess that up?

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:39.140
Now I understand... He's the most
powerfuI Servant, aII right.

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.030
Tohsaka?

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.310
Is Archer--

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.910
Not yet. He's stiII
putting up a fight.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.290
So, do you regret
what you said now?

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.170
I thought I had freed myseIf
from aII that...

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.110
He's aIive?
I don't beIieve it...

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:44.470
Berserker!
Stop pIaying around!

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.880
Something's funny about this guy!
KiII him before he kiIIs you!

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.780
No sIip-ups,
and no hesitation!

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.680
You never did have any
mercy in you, IIIya...

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:58.350
''IIIya''?

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:04.190
My defeat is a foregone concIusion, but you're
going to have to work for it, Berserker.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:10.700
At Ieast go easy on me. In the meantime,
I'II take two more, then be on my way!

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.480
Where is he?

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.210
I don't sense him...
Did he run away?

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.810
So, it Iooks Iike the goddess of the moon
wasn't on your side.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:00.320
I have withstood pain
to create many weapons.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.380
Berserker!

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:10.860
Yet, those hands wiII
never hoId anything.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.570
So, as I pray,

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.810
...UnIimited BIade Works.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.490
What's this?

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.970
A ReaIity MarbIe...?

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:15.380
As you can see, what you face is
unIimited bIades. The pinnacIe of weaponry.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.830
Don't Iet that scare you,
come at me!

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:50.990
Tohsaka?

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.070
Don't teII me--

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:04.140
IIIyasvieI wiII be coming after us soon.
