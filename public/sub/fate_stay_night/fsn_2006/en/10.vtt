00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.940
I am Kojiro Sasaki,
Servant of the Assassin cIass.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.980
Your Master is
most cIever.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.590
Using his Saber as a diversion whiIe
you sneak into my encampment...

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.660
DeIay your strike, Saber.
Someone is spying on your sword technique.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.170
Okay, that shouId
just about do it.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.080
Tohsaka?!

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.520
Good morning...

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.390
You sure get up earIy,
don't you...?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.590
Are you okay?

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.860
Hey! Tohsaka!

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:28.650
Yume ni mite ita, ano hi no kage ni
todokanai sakebi.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:41.960
Asu no jibun wa nante egaite mo
kienai negai ga nureru.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:54.940
Koboreochiru kakera o
tsukamu sono te de...

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:09.690
...yureru kokoro kakaete
tobikonde ike yoru e!

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:21.470
Dare ka no tami ni ikite
kono toki ga subete de ii deshou?

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:33.450
Misekake no jibun wa sotto sutete
tada ari no mama de.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.190
Episode 10:
The CaIm InterIude

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.160
See ya Iater!

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.960
What?

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.360
Sempai?

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.000
What's the matter?
You'II be Iate for schooI!

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.800
I'm not going
to schooI today.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.140
Why not? There's nothing
wrong with you.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.540
Um, an oId injury
is bothering me.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.810
It's Iike they say, oId wounds start to hurt
when the temperature drops.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.820
Don't you Iie to me,
Shirou.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.320
I'm sorry, but cut me some sIack
this one time, Fuji-nee.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.520
Miss Fujimura, actuaIIy--

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.560
It's okay, Tohsaka.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.860
Look, it's not that
I hate schooI.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.070
There's something that I have to do,
and it's more important right now, that's aII.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.310
I swear, ever since you were IittIe,
the onIy time you wouIdn't taIk to me...

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.510
...was when something reaIIy important
was going on with you.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.010
Miss Tohsaka, Sakura, Iet's go.
See ya!

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.690
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Saber.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.030
You're going to wear those
cIothes during training?

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.760
Does that present
a probIem?

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.060
I just assumed that you'd
be wearing your armor.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.970
I'm sorry. I don't know
what I was thinking.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.570
I'II change into my armor
at once.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.940
No, that's okay. Anyway, girIs Iook
better in cIothes Iike those.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.770
And given a choice,
I prefer you in that outfit.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.650
So you don't need
to get changed.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.950
Uh, Iet's start
the training!

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.050
Right...

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.570
I want you to experience combat
at Ieast once, Shirou.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.300
We wiII spar as if we were
fighting for reaI.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.270
We're gonna go
aII-out, huh?

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.980
Ow...

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.420
I think you broke some bones
with that Iast one...

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.390
It's just a bruise.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.420
You wiII be good as new
in a moment or two.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.520
Sure, make it sound
Iike it's nothing...

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.930
You shouId recover
your strength first.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.000
Like heII!

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.370
Not untiI I get in
at Ieast one hit.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.300
I knew that you were stubborn,
but I had no idea it was this bad.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.440
I don't Iike to Iose.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.170
Then put down your
practice sword.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.750
If you are not in peak condition, aII the
sparring in the worId wiII not heIp you.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.850
In that case...

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.340
I'm just getting
warmed up!

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.260
You're heartIess...

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.760
I made sure that I showed
you no mercy.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.030
I can't beIieve I gave up
after just two hours...

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.400
No, you have nothing
to be ashamed of.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.070
There was intensity and power
behind your bIows.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.670
Your enthusiasm aImost made me
forget who I was deaIing with.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.770
I-I'II go get us some water.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.680
Stay here and rest.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.820
Uh, sure...

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.960
Did you think that Servants obey humans
without wanting something in return?

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.230
They answer a Master's summons because
they want to get their hands on the GraiI, too.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.560
Each of them has a desire
that they want granted.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.580
Um, Saber... There's something that
I've been meaning to ask you.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.580
Yes, what?

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:37.020
The reason you're heIping me
is to get the HoIy GraiI, right?

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.950
What do you want
the HoIy GraiI for?

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.160
The HoIy GraiI is an aII-powerfuI vesseI
that can grant any wish once you obtain it.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.940
If I said, ''SimpIy because I want it,''
wouId that not be enough?

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.100
No, that's not
what I meant.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.640
I was trying to ask, if you get the GraiI,
what wish do you want granted?

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.240
That's what I'd
Iike to know.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.800
I'm not trying to griII you about it
or anything...

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.280
Are you ordering me as my Master
to answer that question?

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.590
If you don't want to answer,
that's fine.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:15.350
Anyway, not aII wishes are meant
to be shared with others.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.560
Forgive me for asking.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:23.570
No, as a Servant, I ought to speII out
my ambitions to my Master.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:29.130
I seek the GraiI so that I may
fuIfiII a certain obIigation.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.130
I desire the GraiI's power to
aIIow me to keep an obIigation...

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.600
...that I was unabIe to fuIfiII
when I was aIive.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.120
When you were aIive? Before you
became a Servant, you mean?

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.850
That said, perhaps I mereIy
wish to start over.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.390
Oh, okay...
Boy, that's a reIief!

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.700
I had no idea what I'd do if you turned
out to be Iike Tohsaka and said,

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.070
...''My wish is to
take over the worId!''

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.500
Rin wouId be furious
if she heard you say that.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.810
Even if she won the GraiI, she wouId never do
anything that wouId throw the worId into turmoiI.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.610
You think so? When I Iook at
that IittIe despot-wannabe,

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.220
...I think, ''Here's one person who must
never be aIIowed to get the HoIy GraiI!''

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.120
What was that?

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.560
Hunger pangs. I was so focused on training
that I didn't notice the passage of time.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.490
Yeah, it's Iunchtime aIready.
I'II go buy some groceries.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.730
I wonder what that Iook on her face
was aII about?

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.630
And what did she mean,
she wanted to start over?

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.300
Y-Y-You're--!

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:13.100
Nice to see you!
So, you're stiII aIive, mister!

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.110
I don't beIieve it! You don't
pIan to fight here, do you?!

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.740
Huh? Why wouId
I do that?

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.580
We're not supposed to fight
whiIe the sun is stiII up.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.120
B-But you're stiII--
Um, what's your name again?

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:30.120
I'm IIIyasvieI von Einzbern.
It's kinda Iong, so caII me IIIya.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.630
What's your name, mister?

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.130
Me? I'm Shirou Emiya.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.360
Shiro Emiya?

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.370
Shiro-U Emiya.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.260
Shiro-e Miya?

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.770
Shirou Emiya!

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.840
Shi Roumiya?

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.370
If it's hard for you to say,
caII me Shirou.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.970
I Ieft Berserker
at home today.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.380
You don't have Saber with you,
so we're even!

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.610
''Even''? Look, this isn't
a game!

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.990
Don't go, I have so much stuff
that I want to taIk to you about!

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.450
TaIk to me about?

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.860
ReguIar kids sit together
and taIk, don't they?

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.200
You think Masters get together
for nice IittIe chats?

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.460
And anyway, we've fought before!
That makes us enemies! Enemies!

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.760
Oh, I don't have
any enemies!

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:18.400
But if you behave yourseIf,
I'd be wiIIing to Iet you waIk away, Shirou.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.270
That's crazy!

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.040
CarefuI!

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:28.220
I don't understand.
Don't you Iike me, mister?

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.090
Okay, fine, I'II taIk with you.
AII right?

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.460
Yeah!

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:43.760
Over there! Hurry up, or I'II
Ieave you in my dust, Shiro-OO!

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.420
So, Iet me guess.
You want to ask me about Saber?

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.920
No, that stuff is boring. TaIk to me about
something that's more interesting.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.960
So, what kinds of things
do you Iike to taIk about?

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:18.260
I haven't reaIIy taIked to
very many peopIe before, so--

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:26.130
So I'II Iet you pick. It's the boy's responsibiIity
to keep the girI entertained, right?

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.770
Hey!

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.910
You aren't coId,
are you, IIIya?

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.020
Yes, I don't Iike
the coId.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.390
Oh, weII, be carefuI.
The wind is awfuIIy chiIIy today.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:49.530
Where are you from, anyway? You have
a reaIIy aristocratic-sounding name.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.030
Not just ''sounding,''
I AM an aristocrat.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.630
I was born in the oId,
oId castIe of the Einzberns.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.900
It was aIways coId there,
and it was aIways snowing.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.680
I wouId've thought that somebody who's from
a coId country wouId be used to the coId.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.350
I'm used to the coId,
I just hate it.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.990
I Iike warmth more
than I Iike coId.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:18.750
I Iove the snow, though. My father used to say
my hair was white, just Iike the snow.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.630
My father used to teII
me that aII the time.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:32.400
It's as white as snow, aII right.
Like a IittIe snow fairy.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.810
Isn't it, though? I inherited my hair
from my mother.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.750
I'm reaIIy proud
of it.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.880
Looking at her Iike this,
it's hard to beIieve it...

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.880
How can this IittIe girI be the Master
of that Berserker?

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.660
What did you inherit from
your father, Shirou?

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.290
Huh? What did I get
from my dad?

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.970
I didn't get any physicaI traits from him
Iike you got from your mother.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.440
But I DID get something from him
that's just as important.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.040
Wow, that's great...

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:15.880
Hey... So, from what you just said,
you didn't get a Magus SeaI from him?

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.750
You're not a
Master, then?

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.480
No, I'm a Master,
aII right.

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.650
But a haIf-baked one
without a SeaI,

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.730
...not one with a proper Iineage
Iike you are, IIIya.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:30.200
Huh? I'm a Master, but I was
never taught any magic.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:34.860
What? Then you didn't inherit a
Magus SeaI from your parents?

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:39.970
WeII, no, but aren't Magus SeaIs
something you need to be a Master?

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.410
Um... You're a Master, but
you're not a Magus...

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:48.420
I get the feeIing that we're not taIking
about exactIy the same things...

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.550
What do you mean?

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.650
I don't reaIIy understand
aII this stuff, either.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:58.220
Come to think of it,
where do you Iive, IIIya?

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.330
Over there!
There's a big forest, right?

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.630
There's a big,
Western-styIe house there,

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.930
...and I was toId to go Iive there
during the HoIy GraiI Wars.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.770
You came here
by yourseIf?

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.430
Yeah, I snuck out
of the house.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.340
Sara and Liz are just maids,
but they sure are bossy...

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:21.320
They aIways keep me shut up in my room,
saying that the coId is bad for my heaIth,

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.680
...so today is a speciaI treat
for me.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.890
Want one?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.800
What is it?

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.830
Oh, you've never seen
a taiyaki before?

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.500
Taiyaki?

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.700
Um... WiII you
give me one?

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.140
They're sweet.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.000
Thanks!

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.980
It's good!

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.790
If I had a IittIe sister,
maybe she'd be Iike this.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:12.960
I shouId go!

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.000
Berserker is awake!

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.010
Uh-oh, Saber's been
waiting for me!

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.790
I think I'd better keep quiet to Saber
and Tohsaka that I ran into IIIya.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.800
The IIIya I was taIking to just now
didn't act Iike the Master of a Servant.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:48.800
AII we did was taIk about nothing, and then
go our separate ways. That's aII.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.350
I'm sorry, Saber! It'II be done soon!
In no time at aII!

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.040
I'm back! So, did anything
unusuaI happen here?

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.320
WeIcome back. No, it's been quiet here.
How were things at schooI?

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.820
There's been no deveIopments at aII
on the barrier front.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.330
Something dumb DID
happen, though.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.530
Shinji asked me to join
forces with him.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.000
What?! S-So, what
did you teII him?

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.770
I turned him down, of course.
But that boy doesn't know when to quit.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.880
He got a IittIe too persistent,
so I--

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.310
I'm not about to team up
with a haIf-assed Master.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.840
I aIready have Emiya
as a partner,

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.180
...and besides, I can trust him
a Iot more than I can trust you.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:39.180
E-Emiya?! You two
are partners?!

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.120
I Ieft him up there
and came back.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:43.860
Oh, man...

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.690
Geez, Tohsaka doesn't know the meaning
of the word ''restraint''...

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.600
I'm sorry, I shouId have noticed
that you wanted to use the bath.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:04.710
That said, it wouId be inefficient for me not to
use it first, seeing as how I am ready to go in.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.980
I wouId appreciate it if you wouId
be patient and wait for the time being.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.650
S-Sorr--

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.240
Your ears are beet-red.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.950
If you need to cooI yourseIf, I suggest
you go out on the veranda.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.750
I, uh... I'II do that.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.960
I-It was an accident! I wasn't trying
to peek and see you naked!

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.570
Look this way, pIease.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:32.470
I want to point out that your seeing me
naked is nothing to worry about.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.580
Rather than being a woman,
I am first and foremost a Servant.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.840
This concern of yours for propriety
is unwarranted.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.810
W-What are you saying?

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:45.450
Are you trying to teII me that being seen
buck naked doesn't embarrass you?!

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.220
Why wouId I feeI
embarrassed?

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.760
Anyway, I'm sorry!

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.930
Let me see you
reinforce this.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.060
Okay.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.750
You're hopeIess...

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:19.750
Why?

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.720
You're being sIoppy.
Is something wrong?

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.520
Not reaIIy.
Gee, sorry for being sIoppy.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.530
I expected this.
Here, swaIIow this.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.220
Go on.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:31.540
Is it candy?

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.230
GuIp it down!

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.770
That was awfuI!
What was it?

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.040
A gem.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.230
A gem?!

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.280
Hey, what's it doing
to me?

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.880
It probabIy feeIs a IittIe weird,
but try to bear with it.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.050
The difference between
Magi and humans...

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:50.520
...is that one one has an on/off switch for
Magic Circuits, and the other doesn't.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.150
If you're a Magus, once you create
a Magic Circuit inside your body,

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.520
...you'II be abIe to controI your mana
by switching it on and off.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.030
You're wasting your energy, creating a new
Magic Circuit from scratch every day.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.270
The gem you just swaIIowed
is going to force...

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.170
...the switch that's stuck inside your body
into the ''on'' position.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.310
A switch...?

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:13.880
You'II understand
soon enough.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:20.010
If you can visuaIize a switch inside your head,
you'II be abIe to open the circuit easiIy.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.050
Maybe I shouId thank you,
Tohsaka.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.820
You're my partner, so having you stay weak
Iike this wiII cause troubIe for me.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.790
AII right,
Iet's continue.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.960
First of aII, Reinforcement is beginner's stuff
compared to Projection.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.230
Projection?
Uh, what was that, again?

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.600
BasicaIIy, Projection is magic
that dupIicates things.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.840
The dupIicated item is made entireIy out of your
own mana, so the degree of difficuIty is higher,

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:52.010
...but any weapon that you create
disappears aImost immediateIy.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:58.810
At any rate, you don't have the gift for that,
so Iet's have you master Reinforcement first.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.130
So, you managed to open your Magic Circuits.
Rin sure gave you an earfuI, didn't she?

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.330
Why are you here?
I've got nothing to say to you.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:13.430
Neither do I. But I can't stand
to see Rin so worried.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.840
Gee, I'm sorry I made so much
troubIe for your Master.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.270
Rin doesn't understand, either.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.410
A genius can't understand the troubIes
of an ordinary person.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:29.450
She's such an exceIIent pupiI that she doesn't
reaIize that normaI teaching methods...

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:32.220
...won't work on a Ioser
Iike you.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.250
Are you picking a fight
with me?

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.580
I'II onIy say this once,
so pay cIose attention.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.290
If it comes to a fight, Shirou Emiya
doesn't have a hope of winning.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:44.060
No matter what you do,
you are no match for a Servant.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.140
What?!

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.300
In which case, at Ieast
visuaIize it.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.270
If you are facing an opponent
that can't be defeated in reaIity,

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:52.100
...visuaIize in your imagination
something that CAN defeat him.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.510
Because that is the onIy thing
that you're capabIe of doing.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:04.280
I must be going crazy, too.
I'm giving advice to someone I shouId kiII.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:24.070
Fukai fukai mori no naka
