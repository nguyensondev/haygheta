00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.450
Why are we getting off?

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.710
Iwato Station Knights told us to.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.200
The order came from Diamond Citadel.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.700
They said they couldn't allow
the Hunters through.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.640
How could they do that?

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.480
The Warlord fears Biba-sama.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.780
Iwato's gate is the last fortress
before Diamond Citadel.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.620
I suppose it wasn't going to be easy,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.680
That is why we have prepared for this.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.500
They told Biba-sama not to enter.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.750
Does that mean we're going to be separated?

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.840
Now we'll be able to get away from them.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.230
But...

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.030
Nameless...

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.950
Are you human or a Corpse?!

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.550
I'm neither!

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.550
I'm a Corpseless!

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.450
I will remember that day

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.450
Losing myself

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.750
In steam

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.600
Countless mistakes are made

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.000
When I can't see anything ahead

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.800
You said

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.300
"Ask your own burning blood"

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.550
Answer my beat

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.100
Corpseless of the Iron Fortress

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.050
Stand up

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.550
And slam everything onto the ground

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.800
My soul is devoted to my friend

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.500
Burn your life

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.550
Change the world

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.270
Chapter
Nine

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.270
Fang
of Ruin

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.600
Once we get past this,
the next stop is Diamond Citadel.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.100
If the track maintenance doesn't delay us,
we'll make it in three days.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.770
But without Biba-sama..

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.370
Is it true that there are Corpses
inside the Master Fortress?

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.100
Yes.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.050
And not just one or two.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.750
Probably over a hundred.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.520
Then it's good that we have
distanced ourselves from them.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.770
That's true, but...

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.660
Ikoma.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.820
I agree that Nameless-san shouldn't
be there with them either.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.300
She's...

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.300
I know.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.200
I promise to bring her back.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.600
Ayame-san.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.170
It's time.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.550
I am counting on you.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.650
If this plan succeeds, everyone
is going to be able to be happy.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.140
Indeed.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.250
But we need your help
in order to do that.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.900
Are you up for it?

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.400
Of course.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.350
Lord Maeda has agreed to a meeting.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.900
However...

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.510
...he will only allow women
and children to accompany you.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.410
Just as I had predicted.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.200
Get ready.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.900
Okay.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.300
Nameless...

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.100
That poor girl.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.550
You lied to her, didn't you?

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.500
I did not lie.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.350
Either way...

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.450
...it does not change
what has to be done.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.800
What I have to do as well.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.250
You decided to use me first because
Nameless has returned, didn't you?

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.350
Am I...

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.200
...going to die today?

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.000
Maeda-sama...

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.550
...I wanted to thank you for offering to
prepare the way to Diamond Citadel for us.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.900
It is only natural for the Headquarters
to work for the people.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.850
In any case...

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.350
...I'm sorry for stipulating that only women
and children would be allowed.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.050
If I hadn't, they would not have
agreed to see Biba here.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.300
You will be seeing Biba-sama?

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.900
He said he wanted to discuss
something about food provisions.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.300
I'd like to accommodate him, but...

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.450
Maeda-sama is unfamiliar with the feud
between Biba and the Warlord.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.000
He has put that behind him.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.950
Otherwise, he wouldn't
have spent 10 years...

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.250
...fighting the Corpses for the Headquarters.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.400
They're so stupid.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.600
Did they think these men
would be able to stop us?

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.000
You must not be so overconfident, Nameless.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.800
Those who underestimate their enemies
will not last long in this world.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.650
Death comes swiftly and unexpectedly.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.150
Don't worry.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.150
That day won't come for us until we
bring my brother back to his home.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.000
Ikoma!

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.450
They have arrived.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.840
It is an honor to meet you.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.300
I am the commander of the Hunters...

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.300
...Amatori Biba.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.000
Nameless-san is here too?

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.800
It is an honor.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.400
I finally get the chance
to meet the Great Liberator.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.350
Please, have a seat.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.100
Thank you.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.100
Stop, Itagaki!

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.550
Biba-dono has come to talk!

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.600
He can still talk with a gun pointed at him.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.350
Please sit down.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.150
Brother!

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.200
I'd like to go to the toilet!

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.000
Toilet?

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.200
Hurry up, I can't hold it much longer.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.050
Could I ask that someone take her?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.020
Did you really see Nameless?!

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.900
Yeah!

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.300
She was with Biba!

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.650
Biba too?!

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.310
What is it?!

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.050
There!

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.650
It's Nameless!

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.150
It's almost time.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.350
Yes.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.300
They will be paid back in full.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.400
If I'd kill them, Ikoma wouldn't shut up about it.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:46.650
What?

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.850
Who authorized this?

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.850
It's not fair that they're only keeping us out.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.050
I'm not letting them treat us that way.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.550
Nameless!

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:58.750
What are you doing?!

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.850
I'm just letting the Master Fortress in!

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.100
After everything we've done
fighting the Corpses all this time...

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.000
...they won't let us in?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.170
The Corpses?!

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.050
Why?

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.320
It's the Corpses!

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.060
The Corpses are coming!

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.400
Raise the bridge!

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.100
Get the explosives!

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.700
It's the Corpses!

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.400
The Corpses broke trough!

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.200
The tocsin?

00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:59.850
Why are the Corpses here?!

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.850
Itagaki-sama!

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:20.950
Stop!

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.190
How brave.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.900
I will stop her.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.100
Yukina-san!

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.100
Did you deceive me...?

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.150
Did you deceive me, Biba?!

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.950
Your master is the one...
who deceived me first.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.750
Why are the Corpses here?

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.560
Help!

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.100
No.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.280
This can't be happening.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.050
Nameless!

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.610
Get back here!

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.980
Ikoma, we can deal with her later!

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.660
We need to get back to everyone first.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.430
Come on!

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:10.980
Yeah.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.550
Get away from the door!

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.700
Hurry!

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.730
Don't break formation!

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.250
Hold back the Corpses!

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:34.470
Ikoma!

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.800
Has Ayame-sama returned?

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.870
Not yet.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.350
Even if we returned to the Iron Fortress,
without the master key...

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.100
I will go.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.800
Hold down the fort here.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.220
This all...

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.150
...happened because I opened the gate?

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:58.500
Don't worry.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:10:59.850
We're together.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.200
Are you okay?!

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.900
Don't be afraid...

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.000
Wait!

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.880
What are you thinking,
doing something like this?

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.710
One needs fuel to accomplish anything.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.900
Please come with us, Ayame-sama.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.860
Allow me to treat my friend.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.240
Ayame-sama!

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.550
Where has our lord gone?

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.250
You don't think he left us behind?

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:15.700
A  Railfort?

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.550
Who's operating it?

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:19.250
Who cares?

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.200
We're saved!

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.570
Don't get left behind!

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.220
This station is done for!

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.320
We have to get to Diamond Citadel!

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.750
Fire.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.700
This is retribution...

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:48.500
...for the Headquarters's cowardice
over these last ten years.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.350
Fireless.

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:01.500
Come.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.900
Are you shaking?

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.950
I'm only scared...
because you're scared of me.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.050
Me... scared?

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.250
You are always afraid.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:44.800
What was that?

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.910
That's...

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.150
It's a Black Cloud!

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.450
"Chimera" is such an appropriate name.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:14.450
A man-made hybrid colony
with a Corpseless at its heart.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.400
This is so exciting.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.300
How much will it be able to do?

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.130
I will liberate everything.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.640
The land... the people...

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.570
...their fears as well.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.150
Fireless.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.400
Destroy the gate.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.510
Fire!

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:41.750
Kajika-chan!

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.500
Don't worry, everyone will protect us.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.120
Damn it!

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.090
Take the tank!

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:52.800
Okay!

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.550
Diamond Citadel, this is Iwato!

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.550
A Black Cloud has—!

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.550
Very nice.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.600
We will be able to use that.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.300
Diamond Citadel will not stand a chance!

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.200
Brother!

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.400
Nameless.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:44.850
Good work.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:50.350
Brother, wasn't the purpose of opening
the gate to let the Master Fortress in?

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:51.850
So why...?

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.390
Look, Nameless.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:58.760
This is...

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:03.410
...the world of fairness and equality
that we've been striving for.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.850
Fireless?

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:29.750
Is that Fireless?

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.900
This is sooner than I expected.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.650
It seems the restraints
could not withstand the virus.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.350
Soue-sama, we should give
the white blood to Fireless-dono.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.470
It's no use!

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.250
There's no bringing her
back from this point—

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:00.040
Kurusu!

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.030
I have come to take back Ayame-sama!

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:12.250
Hey, out of my way!

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:17.050
Stop!

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.100
If you do not stop, I will throw this over!

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.700
Ayame-sama!

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.600
Quit that!

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.650
You don't even know what
that's worth, foolish gir!

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:25.650
Stop!

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:32.650
Kurusu!

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.600
F-Fireless... dono...?

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.100
Corpse...

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.600
F— Fire!

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.940
What the hell... is that?

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.990
Protect the commander!

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.470
Fireless, stop!

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.380
No...

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.310
What are you—!

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:51.750
Ikoma!

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.660
Do not resist.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.120
We are interested in your blood.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.160
Resist and we will simply kill you to get it.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.260
Behold!

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.190
This is the world that has been
liberated from its cage!

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.050
I speak to all of you.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.590
Abandon the stations...

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.450
...and join the fight!

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.730
There's no mistaking that you
have been bitten by a Corpse.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.150
No way...!

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.550
Help me!

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.400
Stop!

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.530
I told you not to move.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:28.800
Do it.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.020
What are you doing?

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.860
What is it?! What is the meaning of this?!

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.850
Young master's orders.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.250
To make sure you do not interfere.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.900
It is here where...

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.880
...the cowards will die...

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:55.250
...and only the strong
will be able to survive.

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.050
That is the way of this world!

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.000
Biba!

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.350
Therefore, we...

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.400
...will destroy the very symbol
of mankind's cowardice...

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:12.350
...the Warlord's stronghold, Diamond Citadel,
and liberate us all!

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:13.800
Liberation!

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.100
Liberation!

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:16.500
Liberation!

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:17.950
Liberation!

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.350
Brother...

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:19.350
Liberation!

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:20.750
Liberation!

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.400
...is everything you told before...

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.600
...was a lie?

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:40.900
Even if the stars

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:46.000
That connect you make a sound

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:52.100
There are just dreams in the same rain

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:57.650
And lights are dried up

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:02.900
I am tired of getting answers

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:08.100
By mimicking others

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:13.700
Dawn without the sun

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.900
And broken morning

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:24.750
Smashed cry and dream
The ideal only has its doors

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:30.400
City is uplifted and drown in noise

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.900
I will still sing and stop turning the rudder

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:42.350
To hush silence
