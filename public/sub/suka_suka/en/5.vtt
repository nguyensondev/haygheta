00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.690
We've received a message for you.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.610
You are to report to the base
on Island 49 at noon tomorrow.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.530
About the surface thing?

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.080
I wonder if they want to use
one of our girls to help.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.740
I can't say this excites me.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.920
Oh, no... I forgot the pepper.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.550
Huh?

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.010
Which one's the pepper, again?

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.280
WorldEnd:
What do you do at the end of the world
Are you busy?
Will you save us?

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.560
Get a move on!

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.440
Need medicine here!

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.310
We've sent word to the
Guardian Wings Military.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.150
We just have to take it easy
until help arrives.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.720
Easier said than done.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.990
It'll be fine.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.450
We won't run into any legitimitates,
the Fourths, for a while.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.200
Here.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.790
And why is that?

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.280
They tend to avoid living
close to their own.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.520
There shouldn't be any around here now.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.300
Huh... First I've heard that.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.560
Did you know, Rhan?

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.520
"Humans unleash the beasts
and fill the world

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.300
with the ashen truth."

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.860
Rhan!

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.600
Fix this habit of yours!

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.030
Doesn't Nygglatho always tell you
to focus on food at chow time?

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.430
Eat up already!

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.040
Open your mouth wider!

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.790
They really are just normal kids.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.800
Good. Be sure to chew well.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.040
He was right on the money.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.540
Sky Island 49

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.500
We want to send a rescue
squad to the surface.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.000
Guardian Wings Military Base

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.110
But the Plantaginesta, the Moby-class
transport airship we would use,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.030
is currently being remodeled.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.970
It won't be ready for fifteen days.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.470
Why the heck do you need
such a big ship, anyway?

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.850
Hey...

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.440
Watch your mouth,
Second-Grade Technical Officer!

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.400
I'm a First-Grade Technical Officer!
Your superior!

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.810
Pardon me, First-Grade
Technical Officer, sir!

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.330
I'm a country boy, so please
excuse my lack of manners.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.850
Very well. I forgive you.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.580
See how bighearted a first-grade
technical officer I am?

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.340
Anyway, let's get back on topic.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.550
The Saxifraga's survey team was
going to some big emnetwiht ruins.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.180
They retrieved numerous relics, and we
need a big ship to bring them all back.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.810
Understand, Second-Grade
Technical Officer?

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.190
Uh-huh...

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.680
Excuse me?

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.480
I fully understand, First-Grade
Technical Officer, sir!

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.670
But the longer the rescue op is delayed,

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.210
the more danger the survey team faces.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.370
That's why we sent two swords
with them in the first place.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.000
I hope they do their jobs, even if
they must sacrifice themselves.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.720
Is something wrong?

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.520
Not at all.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.240
You are absolutely correct,
sir wise First-Grade Technical Officer.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.840
It's hard to read a disfeatured's
facial expressions.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.020
Here. Go through this.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.340
"Ground Level K96-MAL Ruins

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.480
Second Survey Report."

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.200
Once you read it, you will see
the importance of this survey.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.510
Hang on.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.980
Streets with thick stone paving.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.580
Jerry-built housing blocks.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.440
No doubt about it.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.040
This is Gomag City,
in Imperial territory.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.800
My... birthplace.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.270
The next page lists their finds,
including talismans and the like.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.850
All those precious objects
await our rescue.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.060
"Dug weapon Lapidemsibilus"?

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.140
This is it! This sword can...

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.250
Sir bighearted First-Grade
Technical Officer.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.250
Oh? What is it, Second-Grade
Technical Officer?

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.620
I have a favor to ask.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.170
What took you so long?

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.560
Sorry. It's a long story.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.760
Give me a second.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.180
Let me finish this.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.140
No need to rush.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.520
That was delicious.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.230
Let's go.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.960
Now can you tell me why you came along?

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.210
I wanted to buy something.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.190
And the others gave me a big list.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.650
Well, you seem to be enjoying yourself.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.600
It isn't often you and I can take
a leisurely stroll alone.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.080
In fact, I don't think it has ever happened.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.820
Did you forget how we ran all over
the place when we first met?

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.620
Uh, right.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.880
But that kind of didn't have
the same feel, you know?

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.550
Come on, let's go.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.260
Chtholly?

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.710
Is that a cute missus I see?

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:22.710
Missus?

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.600
Are you newlyweds?
I'll give you a discount.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.040
No, we're—

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.340
That's right! Thank you very much!

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.220
Are you finished shopping, "missus"?

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.070
Yes, thanks for all your help.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.730
Newlyweds, huh?
So we looked like a couple.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.930
Are you really happy with this?

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.400
You're finally free to roam
outside the island now,

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.240
so why come with me to shop?

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.270
Oh, please... Quit playing dumb
when you know the answer.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.370
I don't care where it is.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.170
I just want to be with you.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.680
I have no idea what you see in me.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.760
I was ordered to send
a fairy soldier to the surface.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.400
Okay.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.790
I picked Nephren.
And I'll be going with her.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:28.470
Okay.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.030
I'm done just sitting around
and waiting for someone to return.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.060
Also, I'm interested in a sword
they found on the surface.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.200
A sword?

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.320
It's called Lapidemsibilus.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:48.070
I think it has a special ability that keeps
its wielder in tip-top mental condition.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.220
Huh...

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.520
You're putting on a brave face, right?

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.830
The disintegration might
worsen at any moment,

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:01.220
so I figured the sword could help
if it ever came down to it.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.800
You were worried about me, huh?

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.920
Did you really think I wasn't?

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.710
But don't worry. Nothing has
happened since that one time.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:18.380
I even sparred for a while
with Tiat the other day,

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.930
and I was fine afterward.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:20.780
I'm perfectly—

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.410
You're no longer a leprechaun.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.160
There's no telling what's
happening inside your body.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.180
So please don't push yourself.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.420
Okay.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.090
So, when are you leaving?

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.790
Not for a while yet.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.140
Look after the others.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.510
I'm going, too.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:49.920
I said I'm going with you.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.730
Hey, I just said not to push yourself.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.270
I know!

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.400
But I don't want to sit and wait
for you to return, either.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.720
Wait, wait... That's not gonna fly.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.250
You're not a fairy anymore.
You can't come along to sightsee...

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.580
You think I'd suggest this just to sightsee?

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.910
Uh, wait. That's not what I meant!

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.660
I'm saying it's not a place
you can casually go.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.940
You think I'm being casual about this?

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.050
Now I'm mad!

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.460
I'm going with you, no matter what!

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.380
Oh, come on...

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.910
You know that's not happening!

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.990
Looks like it is happening.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.350
Yay, I got permission!

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.310
You sure did.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.500
Wait, are you mad?

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.850
Don't you realize why you got permission?

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.780
Uh... Because a second-grade
technical officer introduced me?

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.400
He thought you were my lover.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.450
Lover?

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.880
Apparently, officers often take lovers
on trips as their secretaries.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.890
And that's what he thinks I'm doing.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:01.580
Lover...

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.620
I think it's fine!

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.360
Uh, it's not fine.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.550
I guess.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.050
Let's go back to "missus," then.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.550
Oh, for...

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.600
Well, whatever.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.320
I don't wanna be separated from you, either.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.280
Wait, wait!

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.830
That makes me very happy,
but it sadly wasn't a proposal, right?

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.090
Duh.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.340
"I don't wanna be separated
from you, either," huh?

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.920
Oh, no... I forgot the pepper.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.890
Second from the right, window side.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.670
Pepper!

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.560
Hup.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.190
TO...

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.560
Hey, TO.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.780
Ithea?

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.420
Aye aye.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.990
It's your beloved Ithea Myse Valgulious.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.210
If you want anything for breakfast,
better hit the mess hall soon.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.320
Right.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:19.420
Ow.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.840
You were my blanket, Ren?
No wonder it felt so warm.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.720
Yep.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.150
It gets chilly this time of year,
and I didn't want you to catch a cold.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.600
This should be really problematic
when you think about it.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.340
So why doesn't it come across that way?

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.230
Because your mind isn't
completely in the gutter yet.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.520
And you've basically reached
pet status, Nephren.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.740
You okay with that?

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.410
Providing emotional support is crucial.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.450
It's a worthwhile role.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.080
Is that so?

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.280
Anyway, what were you researching all night?

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.130
Dug weapon Lapidemsibilus.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.710
It could stop Chtholly's
mental disintegration.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.380
Huh...

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.130
What?

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.840
I'm just wondering if she actually
has a chance with you.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.090
She's had a big one all along.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.110
Some may hold out longer,

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:13.370
but no man can remain unfazed forever
when a cute girl likes him.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.330
But I still can't give in, which is why
I'm trying to keep her at arm's length.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.610
Wow.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.660
Don't you dare tell her.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.150
You slept with Nephren?

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.520
Why does everyone have to be like this?

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.910
What, exactly, is the problem with
a parent and child sleeping together?

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.470
Spare me. You aren't much
older than she is!

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.630
People tend to think I'm a young guy,

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.660
but I'm actually more than
five hundred years old.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:45.600
Well, I can guess Nephren
probably snuggled in herself.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.730
You don't have to guess.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.920
But I still can't accept it!

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.210
I know you can sense
people sneaking up on you!

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.800
Only the hostile ones.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.240
I don't notice the mostly harmless.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.840
Then let me ask you this.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.170
What if it were Nygglatho?

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.230
Defenestrated in two seconds flat.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.190
That isn't how it went with Nephren.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.840
Nygglatho might not be hostile,
but she is harmful.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.660
What sane person sleeps around
someone who wants to eat them?

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.130
And if it were me?

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.620
Huh? Well, you know...

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.940
I'd throw you out, obviously.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.930
Please take more care in the future.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.530
You don't want the little ones
to start doing it too, right?

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.780
Huh? R-Right...

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.740
I give up.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.000
I have no idea why Chtholly
isn't a leprechaun now,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.700
or why her hair changed color.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.930
What about you?

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.860
Will the dug weapon on the surface
really come in handy?

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.120
Willem?

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.410
Oh, sorry.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:01.630
Chtholly was acting kinda weird
this morning, you see.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.470
So I said I'd throw her out, obviously.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.960
I thought she'd be mad over why
it's okay with Ren and not her,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.840
but she just walked away.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.250
Is she still not well?

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.150
For such a perceptive guy,
you can be amazingly obtuse.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.910
What's that supposed to mean?

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:31.400
She was happy that you put her
in the same category as me.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.120
Why would that make her happy?

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.370
Because I'm the rival in love
she's most worried about.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:43.580
And treating us the same would mean
you also see her as a girl.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.710
Huh? Rival in love?

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.210
Yes.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:51.770
Are you saying she thinks
we could get together?

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.980
That would be the implication.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.810
I guess at her age,

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:59.600
you tend to get the wrong
idea about these things.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.700
I wouldn't say it's the "wrong idea," exactly.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:08.360
I actually do rate you quite highly as a man.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:11.860
Huh?

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:18.140
Honestly, I wouldn't mind
being with a man like you.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.920
Our races aren't very different,

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.670
so I might be able to provide
you with kids of your own.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.630
If I could be part of your happiness
in five or ten years' time,

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:32.090
I would love nothing more.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.400
Well, Chtholly's happiness
takes priority for me,

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.830
so I'm not about to go all out for the kill.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:46.890
But she simply can't bring herself
not to consider me a threat.

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.860
Well? Make sense to you now?

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.000
I'm gonna make a really despicable request.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.490
And what might that be?

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.420
Can I pretend I didn't hear any of that?

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.690
You weren't kidding. That is despicable.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.540
But...

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.980
It's fine by me.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.200
Hurry!

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:13.950
Yeah!

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.100
Last one there's a loser!

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.630
Wait for me!

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.430
Hey, watch out! Don't—

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.010
Don't run in the halls!

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.640
What's gotten into them?

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.470
Shooting stars.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.230
So pretty!

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.880
Over there! And there!

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.950
How very spectacular.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.540
There are a lot tonight.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.350
Oh, look.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.920
Here comes a whole bunch!

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.200
Hold it right there!

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:40.360
But we'll miss the shooting stars!

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.240
You're supposed to dry your hair
as soon as you get out of the bath!

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.770
You'll catch a cold!

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.060
Tiat's playing the "big sis"
role to perfection.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.160
She's probably imitating me.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.660
Not too long ago, I was running
around after her like that.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.320
Ah, yeah. I can totally see that.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.510
Thank you.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.500
For looking out for me.
Like taking me to the surface.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.300
Nah, I'm just doing it for
my own peace of mind.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.250
Don't worry about it.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.640
Let me thank you anyway.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.430
Hey, Almita!

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.140
Almita!

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:32.680
Please make it!

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:51.660
Chtholly!

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.500
Chtholly?

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.380
Chtholly!

00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.020
Oh... Don't cry out like that.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.630
Some grown-up you are.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.080
I'm fine, see?

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.390
Uh...

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.060
Sh-She's all right, too.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.240
Chtholly!

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.840
Y-You're too close!

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.060
I really don't mind...

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.430
But not like this!
Once more, from the top!

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.940
You're not a leprechaun anymore!

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.940
You can't generate venenum like that!

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.820
What if things go wrong?

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.410
I...

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.370
I thought I was gonna lose you again,
even though I was right here!

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.360
You're one to talk,
with your wreck of a body.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.400
I'm perfectly fine.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.230
I'm a bit numb, but this will
go back to normal in no time.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.890
You aren't pretending, right?

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.370
No faith in me at all, huh?

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.840
You're all banned from the roof!

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.260
Get all the kids there downstairs!

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.700
G-Got it!

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.990
What? What's happening?

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.710
Nothing to worry about.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.910
I'll take her to the bath.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.170
Handle the rest with Nygglatho
and the others.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.560
O-Okay.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.860
Come on, let's go.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:17.880
Y-Ya...

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.850
I'm sowwy.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:27.850
Tiat is the one you should apologize to.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:31.470
If you'd listened to her, you wouldn't
have put yourself in danger.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.560
Y-Ya.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:35.750
I'm sorry.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.220
Close your ears.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.690
Time to switch.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:45.430
Ya!

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.460
Huh?

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:09.010
Chtholly? What's wrong?

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.720
a red-haired girl

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.270
is

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.190
looking at me

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.130
Elq?

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.960
Next Episode

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.960
moonlit sorcery

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:07.380
Next Episode:

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.610
moonlit sorcery.
