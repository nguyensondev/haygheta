00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.650
Don't drop the pressure!

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.600
If we stop, it's all over!

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.750
Yes, sir.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.400
Make the announcement.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.900
Yes, sir.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.650
We're passing through the abandoned station.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.000
Please brace for impact.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:08.850
Damn it!

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.250
Get out of here!

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.750
Stay back!

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.900
What you need to survive...

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.550
It's not some tool that will
keep you hidden and safe.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.250
It's the power to fight the Corpses without fear.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.900
Shingo!

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.550
Are you okay?!

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.750
Yeah.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.200
I owe you.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.100
You...!

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.450
Twenty years ago...

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.300
...the people of Japan...

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.350
...have locked themselves in fortified stations out of fear of the Corpses.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.550
They abandoned their pride and fellow man...

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.350
...and run away.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.150
Use it.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.750
Use it!

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.950
The suicide bag!

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.150
Hurry up!

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.200
Show us what you're made of!

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.300
Don't be a disgrace!

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.200
What are you doing?!

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.550
Pull it! Pull it!!!

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.000
Can we really be proud of our survival...
that's predicated on sacrificed our own?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.500
And we lose not only the lives of our friends.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.850
That's why...

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.250
...I...

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.500
Mother...

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.850
Damn it!

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.850
I want the power to defeat the Corpses.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.900
I'm... so close!

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.350
You're awake?

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.650
The Warriors held them off.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:41.850
You can go back to sleep.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.400
For now.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:49.550
Did...

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.900
...another station get overrun?

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.650
Chapter
One

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.650
Frightened
Corpse

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.300
Hey, did you hear?

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.500
They said the supplies are late.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.200
I guess the front line fell back again.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.750
How long is this place going to last?

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.700
Stop it, don't say that!

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.950
What if a Warriors heard you?!

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.500
Hey there, hero!

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.500
Running late?

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.000
Watch your calculation.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.900
Plate 3 needs more adhesive.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.600
Heeeey, Ikoma!

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.200
How did yesterday go?

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.400
No good.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.900
It should have plenty of pressure, but...

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.250
What's wrong with using
normal lead shots again?

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.400
Because then it'd be the same
as the Warrior's steam guns.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.000
It will just get repelled by
the Corpse's heart cage.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.500
That's why we need jet bullets.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.050
We need more penetrating power!

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.300
And you're going to use that to fight
the Corpses instead of the Warriors?

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.250
You must be insane or something...

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.900
Did you up the explosives?

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.450
Come on, because you just increased
the cavity in the last tune-up.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.750
That's it, Takumi!

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.500
Why did I skip a step?

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.100
Where are you going?

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.350
I'm going home to start over.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.850
Hey, hey!

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.650
At least finish your work here first...

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.250
Hey, it's Ayame-sama.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.650
From the Yomokawa family?

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.400
I like to check everything myself.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.450
Oh, isn't it Ayame-sama.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.450
How can we help you?

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.500
It's my father's steam gun.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.300
It's having some problems, so I was
hoping someone could take a look.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.000
We would be happy to.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.200
Ayame-sama.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.400
She is beautiful.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.550
She is the Warriors princess.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.500
Ikoma!

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.750
Come here and help Ayame-sama!

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.650
Here's your chance, hero.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:35.500
Allow me to take that.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.500
Do you want to become a hero?

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.550
I just don't like having to run away.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.750
Ayame-sama...

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.300
...where will you be pointing this?

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.100
The west gate is opening!

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.450
The Iron Fortress is coming!

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.350
The Iron Fortress should be coming tomorrow.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.200
Let's go.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.450
The Iron Fortress?

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.500
The Tree Fortress is supposed to come tonight.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.100
Two Railforts in one day...?

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.200
Father, wasn't the Iron Fortress supposed to arrive tomorrow?

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.450
Hayatani Station has been lost.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.150
With less stops to make,
of course it would arrive earlier.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.500
No way...

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.750
Get the inspection box!

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.500
I wonder if anyone's been bitten.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.450
That's what they're about to find out.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.500
They search for bite marks to determine
if they have been infected by a Corpse.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.950
If they find one, they throw them in jail.

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.600
It's what the authorities always do.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.400
Well of course they do.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.150
That one might be infected.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.500
All right, start the maintenance!

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.050
Hey, look!

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.400
Just the carotid artery is thicker.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.250
So the virus really does pass through here.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.150
Hey!

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.950
It's rare to find this good of a specimen.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.750
You're breaking the rules!

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.850
This isn't some curse.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.500
We both know it!

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.550
What?

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.500
Some kid of a bigwig?

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.300
What is it?

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.300
Oh, nothing.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.000
Hey!

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.200
You there, kid!

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.550
The exit is the other way.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.000
Even children have to go through inspect—

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.850
Only a fool would judge a book by its cover.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.100
It's what my brother always
told me, Mustache-san.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.650
Wh-What did you say?!

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:12.400
Enough.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.800
She is my guest.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.500
My lord!

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.150
Are you the boss here?

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.000
I am Kensho, head of
the Yomokawa Family.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.000
Yomokawa-dono, thank you
for your hospitality.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.050
Shimon-sama, I presume?

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.400
I have read your letter.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.900
We would like to take you
to our mansion first.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.500
They're not going to be inspected?

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.800
What is going on?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.150
Who are they?

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.000
No idea...

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.500
It's a Corpse!

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.650
He has a wound!

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.500
Don't let him get away!

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.450
A Corpse?

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.350
Stop right there!

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.450
No! I'm not a Corpse!

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.300
Stop!

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.150
Kill him!

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.400
Surround and kill him!

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.400
I swear, it's not a bite!

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.450
Please help me!

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.000
Stop!

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.500
Who the hell are you?!

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.250
He's saying he's not a Corpse!

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.000
Like we can trust him!

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.750
Stop, you coward!

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.200
Those suspected of being a Corpse

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.150
are to be locked up for three
days and kept under watch!

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.100
You're the ones who made the rule!

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.000
Shut up!

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.600
This matter doesn't concern a lowly steam smith!

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:45.500
I'm trying to tell you that you're pointing
your guns at the wrong targets!

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.600
Father!

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.950
Corpse's...?

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:57.850
Disgusting!

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:58.850
Why does he have them?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.100
Answer me!

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.000
Why do you have something like that?!

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:05.800
He's getting away!

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.900
Don't!

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:24.850
He's died...

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.400
Which means...

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.600
He wasn't a Corpse?

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.200
Y-You aren't even ashamed?

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.100
Being so afraid of everything?!

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.100
For losing your sanity?!

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.000
Those are some lofty words.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.250
A privilege afforded to you because of the
guaranteed safety the Warriors provide.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.250
You're wrong!

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.000
I will fight too!

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.250
Kurusu!

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.250
Yes, sir.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.750
I'm close to finishing the steam g—

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.000
Throw him in jail.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.100
He may be a Corpse.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.100
Father!

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:02.850
Let's go.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.550
Ayame.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.800
Defending order is also a Warrior's duty.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.900
The order...

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:15.700
...is it?

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.300
I see.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.850
You're both headed to Diamond Citadel?

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.200
Then, the Warlord-sama is...?

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.850
No, not yet.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.150
That is why the two of us are going alone.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.000
It's June.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.650
Almost time, brother.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.150
I knew it!

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.300
It's the corpse gatherer.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.250
You're...

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:07.850
Nameless.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.200
"Nameless"?

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.900
Is that a name?

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.150
Nice, isn't it?

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.050
My brother gave it to me.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:21.250
Hey, did you know that the guy
from before, wasn't a Corpse?

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.900
No...

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.500
But I couldn't just ignore it.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.050
Normally, you would.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.250
Then there's something
wrong with being normal.

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:32.450
You're interesting.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.200
What is it?

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.050
I mean, it's normal to be
scared of the Corpses, right?

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.850
People are generally frightened cowards.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.300
They can do nothing about it.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.750
Yes, they can.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.800
They can do nothing
but kill others out of fear?

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.200
That's unthinkable to me.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.600
You cannot lose your humanity to fear.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.050
Ikoma is a dumbass.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:02.950
Getting all worked up like that.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.450
What a self-righteous idiot.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.850
But...

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.550
...it's something I couldn't do even if I tried.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.550
Talking back to a Warriors like that.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.650
That's what makes him stupid!

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.600
It's here! It's the Tree Fortress!

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.800
It's right on time this time.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:43.950
It's going too fast!

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.250
Slow down!

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.150
Damn it! Raise the bridge!

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.200
Hurry up!

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:01.800
It's too late!

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.300
What?!

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.100
It's the Corpses!

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.000
Out of the way!

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
It's the Corpses!

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.100
That's...

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.150
...the tocsin?

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.000
Don't tell me...!

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.200
The Corpses are here?!

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.450
I have to go.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.600
I need to get my piercing gun!

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.700
Hurry up!

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.250
I'm taking these too.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.650
Nameless.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.200
They have broken through the west gate.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.300
This whole place is lost.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:48.900
But—

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.050
We're going to the Iron Fortress.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:51.250
Come.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.650
Father, where are you going?

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.400
To the Iron Fortress.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.300
You're not...?

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.550
Are you abandoning this station?!

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.550
I will give the signal when the
Iron Fortress has been secured.

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:05.700
Come when you see it.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.850
The Corpses react to blood.

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:26.850
Damn it, that hurts!

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.100
Stop!

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.600
Take off your clothes immediately!

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.750
Are you kidding me?!

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.250
The Corpse are coming!

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.650
That's why you have to show that
you don't have wounds on your body!

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:39.150
What's going to happen to us?

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.750
Where's Ikoma?!

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.450
He took the bait!

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.400
I won't fail this time!

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.800
I've increased the explosives this time!

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:41.650
I did it!

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.950
My piercing gun...

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.750
...bore right through its heart!

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.500
My!

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.650
I did it!

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.250
I see it!

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:03.850
It's the Iron Fortress.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.600
Nameless-dono.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.050
You will have to continue on alone.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:15.950
Go to Diamond Citadel...

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.400
...and please await the
Young Master's orders.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.600
I leave the rest...

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:22.250
...in your hands.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.600
May karma smile upon you.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:55.150
It's not a curse.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.500
I just need to make sure the virus doesn't reach my brain!

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:05.700
Five years...

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:07.350
It's been five years!

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.100
For whose sake I was working...

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.900
...to be able to fight the Corpses...?!

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.500
I'm...

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.400
...not the same as I was then!

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.050
I...

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:44.900
...will never run away...

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
...again!

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:08.500
This time...

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:10.450
I...

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.550
I will become someone I can be proud of!

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.200
I will remember that day

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.100
Losing myself

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.500
In steam

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:06.200
Countless mistakes are made

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:11.850
When I can't see anything ahead

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.500
You said

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:20.050
"Ask your own burning blood"

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:23.300
Answer my beat

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:29.900
Corpseless of the Iron Fortress

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.700
Stand up

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:38.150
And slam everything onto the ground

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:43.500
My soul is devoted to my friend

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.200
Burn your life

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:52.200
Change the world
