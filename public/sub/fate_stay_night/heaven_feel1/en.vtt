00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:26.569
A YEAR AND A HALF AGO
SUMMER

00:00:57.767 --> 00:00:59.769
Shirou Emiya is pretty good.

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.604
Isn't he?

00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:04.356
And with Ayako Mitsuzuri and Shinji Matou,

00:01:04.607 --> 00:01:06.984
we can win the rookie tournament
with this lineup.

00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:08.944
Yep, yep!

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:11.906
But, Miss Fujimura...

00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:16.619
Among the first-years, Emiya is somehow...

00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:19.205
different from the others.

00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:22.291
I can't really put it into words.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.433
You got injured at your part-time job
before the tournament?

00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:40.851
What were you thinking?

00:01:41.852 --> 00:01:45.106
Can't you tell you've caused trouble
for everyone?

00:01:45.815 --> 00:01:46.941
My bad.

00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:49.360
But Shinji, with you
and Mitsuzuri on the team,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.529
you wouldn't need me...

00:01:57.952 --> 00:01:59.036
Sorry.

00:02:13.968 --> 00:02:15.219
I'm home!

00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:38.951
Don't worry. After you get some rest,
come back to the club practice.-Taiga
PSI I'll come check on you later!

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:56.218
Beginning synchronization.

00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:01.557
Tracing basic structure.

00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:05.060
Tracing component materials.

00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:08.063
Altering fundamental structure.

00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:11.567
Strengthening component materials.

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:38.719
Rain, huh?

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:11.627
You're Shinji's little sister...

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.630
Yes.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.717
I'm Sakura Matou.

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.650
Shirou, I came to check up on you!

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.820
How's your shoulder doing?

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:44.910
No, that's not it!
In any case, it's not what you think!

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:47.871
I'm telling you.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:51.125
I've been somehow managing
by myself all this time.

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:56.130
Besides, I can't make
a friend's little sister help me out.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.470
As Shirou's guardian,
I don't think I can let you.

00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:08.434
I'll support him with all housework,
so you don't need to worry!

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.367
Well, we happened to run into each other!

00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:29.371
Next, the topic for today is-

00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:32.291
The dishes are in the upper cupboard.

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:35.878
And in the lower cupboard,
there's the rice bin, kitchen knives and...

00:05:37.338 --> 00:05:38.922
H-Hey!

00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:49.725
First, fold back from the back side
around the middle of the shoulder.

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:53.437
Fold the sleeves
so that they are parallel to the creases.

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.775
Do the same to the other side.
Be careful so that it holds its shape.

00:06:00.903 --> 00:06:04.114
W-Well, this is good enough.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.200
I'm going to do it again.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.499
Okay then, let's try from the beginning.

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:18.295
Then, please excuse me.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:21.090
See you tomorrow, Sakura!

00:06:32.101 --> 00:06:34.395
That's right, I remember now.

00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:37.439
That day, a year and a half ago,

00:06:37.523 --> 00:06:42.611
I'd lost against an unexpectedly
stubborn girl younger than me.

00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:50.869
A YEAR AND THREE MONTHS AGO
FALL

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:51.870
Seasons changed since.

00:06:52.413 --> 00:06:56.208
Even after my shoulder healed,
this life didn't change.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:59.336
I can't remember
because Sakura suggested so...

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:01.839
or I wanted so...

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:05.717
I'm sure that was a trivial reason.

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.472
If there's anything that's changed,

00:07:11.098 --> 00:07:13.350
it's the fact that I don't go
to team practice anymore.

00:07:14.143 --> 00:07:17.271
Well, I wanted to increase my hours
at my part-time job,

00:07:17.688 --> 00:07:20.566
and it didn't matter what I did
as long as I could train my body.

00:07:21.233 --> 00:07:24.153
So, how to put it...
I think it was the right timing.

00:07:30.576 --> 00:07:34.496
There's one other thing that may be trivial.

00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:39.418
I'm home!

00:07:40.836 --> 00:07:43.380
Oh, welcome home, Senpai.

00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:51.680
I don't use my key much anymore, I think.

00:07:56.351 --> 00:08:00.856
A YEAR AND TWO MONTHS AGO
WINTER

00:08:14.203 --> 00:08:15.412
Yoo-hoo!

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:17.581
Merry Christmas!

00:08:18.874 --> 00:08:20.584
As I said...

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:28.300
Shirou was mimicking Kiritsugu
the whole time...

00:08:28.592 --> 00:08:31.094
saying, "I will be a hero of justice!"

00:08:31.303 --> 00:08:32.846
What are you talking about?

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.932
Jeez, you drunkard!

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:37.392
Kiritsugu...

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:40.437
is your father, correct?

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:42.564
Yep.

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:46.735
For Shirou, Kiritsugu was a hero!

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.322
So that's probably why
he was mimicking him.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.825
Sakura, you have someone
like that, too, right?

00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:02.209
My hero...

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:24.106
10 MONTHS AGO
SPRING

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.317
Senpai!

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:35.826
Hey, Emiya!

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:37.536
Hey, Issei.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.038
Oh, if it isn't you, Emiya!

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:42.374
You should help us recruit new members!

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.668
Oh, this girl...

00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:47.421
Oh, this is Shinji's little sis...

00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:48.964
No way!

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:52.134
Hey, you! Are you interested in archery?

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:54.970
Since your big brother practices,
you surely must be interested!

00:09:55.053 --> 00:09:56.263
Oh, what's your name?

00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:58.390
I'm Sakura.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.644
Sakura, huh? Well then,
let's join the archery club!

00:10:02.728 --> 00:10:04.813
Or have you already decided
what club to join already?

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:05.897
N-No.

00:10:05.981 --> 00:10:07.316
Then, let's join!

00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:09.735
Jeez, so pushy.

00:10:09.735 --> 00:10:11.236
It's fine, it's fine! Done deal!

00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:17.659
What's wrong, Emiya?

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.036
Nothing.

00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:21.496
Hey, Shirou!

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.837
Thank you so much, teacher, sir.

00:10:29.171 --> 00:10:31.173
Fuji-nee, you're a teacher, too.

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:33.508
Oops!

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:44.269
Senpai?

00:10:44.645 --> 00:10:45.771
Oh, nothing.

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:49.066
Okay, then everyone, smile!

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:56.323
THREE MONTHS AGO
FALL

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:30.899
Trace on.

00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:43.078
I have to take it apart again!

00:11:46.707 --> 00:11:49.167
Sakura!

00:11:49.418 --> 00:11:52.254
What's for dinner tonight?

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:56.758
I got some good eggplants,
so I think I'll make some arrabiata.

00:11:57.008 --> 00:12:00.053
Wow, I'm looking forward to it!

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:08.186
Oh, this again.

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:13.233
An old memory is swept away
by the color of flames.

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:18.613
I am not allowed to wallow
in my memories, it says.

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:21.658
Every time I'm dreaming...

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:23.952
I arrive at the usual terminus.

00:12:25.287 --> 00:12:28.957
In other words, it' means
I'm going fo wake up soon.

00:12:35.464 --> 00:12:36.798
Senpai?

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.344
Good morning!

00:12:46.892 --> 00:12:48.685
Good morning, Sakura!

00:12:51.313 --> 00:12:57.694
A DAY AGO

00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:00.238
Sakura, you have your own daily life.

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.157
It's fine.

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:06.077
My only hobbies are cooking and archery.

00:13:06.912 --> 00:13:11.166
And my future goal is to cook something
tastier than your dishes.

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:13.752
And I think I'll be getting in range
pretty soon.

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:15.045
Really?

00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:19.299
Can it be that you've been stealing
our secrets every day?

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:20.342
Yes!

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.302
You'd better be prepared for that day!

00:13:23.637 --> 00:13:25.305
Besides,

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:31.520
I can no longer enjoy meals
unless I'm at your place.

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:35.357
Hey now.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.777
If you don't hurry,
you won't make it to morning practice!

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:48.537
Emiya, are you dating Matou's little sister?

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:53.291
Oh, well.

00:13:53.542 --> 00:13:57.420
I happened to see you two coming
to school together like a happy couple.

00:13:57.671 --> 00:14:01.508
She's my friend's little sister!
Of course not!

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.719
In fact, if you saw me,
why didn't you call out to me?

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:09.432
I'm still a monk in training,

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:12.269
so I don't have such nerves.

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:14.437
Jeez.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.566
Here! I finished one!

00:14:27.284 --> 00:14:28.827
Morning, Shinji!

00:14:29.578 --> 00:14:30.912
Hey, Emiya.

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:33.665
Are you helping others again
from the early hours?

00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:36.585
You really are whimsical, aren't you?

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:38.670
Well, I have plenty of time, you know.

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:41.339
If you need anything,
you can tell me, Shinji.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.427
You were never very good
at re-stringing and mending bows.

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:47.137
You know, Emiya.

00:14:47.888 --> 00:14:50.974
You have nothing to do
with the archery club anymore, right?

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:56.438
It'd be better for you if you kept
your nose out of others' affairs.

00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:03.778
Well, we'll start with the pronunciation!

00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:07.282
Even if it's spelled the same way,
it won't be pronounced as such.

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:09.910
It's easy to make mistakes here,
so be careful!

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.458
Emiya, what about lunch?

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.794
Sorry. I'm going to eat
in the cafeteria today.

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:31.181
Hey, Sakura-

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:44.402
Sakura...

00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:48.031
Senpai...

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.533
Oh, that just now was...

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.745
Yes, one of the second-years, Tohsaka-

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:54.913
That was Tohsaka, right?

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:56.247
Rin Tohsaka.

00:15:58.083 --> 00:16:01.127
You know of her?

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:04.172
Yeah. Well, she's famous.

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:06.633
And she always kind of stands out, so...

00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:09.094
You're right.

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:14.265
Miss Tohsaka is so pretty and cool.

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:34.285
Sakura?

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:40.792
Senpai,

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:44.546
you're not planning on returning
to the archery club anymore?

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.549
Well, see...

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:51.302
Wouldn't Shinji hate it if I did?

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:59.060
I'm sure Big Brother just finds it difficult
to deal with you.

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:03.231
But he likes you a lot more than the others.

00:17:03.773 --> 00:17:05.734
He's not an honest person,

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:09.404
so he tends to like the people he dislikes.

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:13.867
That's a troublesome personality.

00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:17.662
See you, then.

00:17:42.062 --> 00:17:43.438
Insects are chirring?

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:47.984
In winter?

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:50.361
Come now.

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:56.618
I hear you're taking good care
of my granddaughter.

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:58.328
Oh, excuse me.

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.747
My name is Shirou Emiya.

00:18:01.456 --> 00:18:03.541
I'm a classmate of Shinji's.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.460
Emiya...

00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:09.839
Is the Einzbern girl doing well?

00:19:12.569 --> 00:19:14.737
This dream again.

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.244
After this,

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:24.330
I was saved by Kiritsugu.

00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:35.425
If you don't summon yours soon,

00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:39.429
you're gonna die,

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:41.431
Big Brother.

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:48.897
SUSPICION OF FLEEING FROM CAR

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:51.399
GAS LEAK IN NEW CITY'S OFFICE DISTRICT

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:52.984
Late last night, there was a massive
gas leak in a large-scale facility

00:19:52.984 --> 00:19:57.197
TODAY

00:19:57.197 --> 00:19:59.240
It is believed that the leak originated
in one of the underground restaurants...

00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:00.200
All right!

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:02.493
Sakura, get me a plate.

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:03.912
Oh, sure.

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:11.544
What's wrong?

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.968
Sakura, are you all right?

00:20:19.594 --> 00:20:22.222
You weren't eating
any of the breakfast, either.

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:25.850
It's all right to skip morning practice.

00:20:26.142 --> 00:20:27.936
Your club advisor said it's okay, too.

00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:31.731
No, I'm fine.

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:38.738
Senpai...

00:20:40.031 --> 00:20:41.532
I have a favor to ask.

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:49.457
Can you come home
as soon as possible after school today?

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.335
This news just in.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.255
Early this morning, in a home
in the Miyama Town district of Fuyuki,

00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:57.507
four residents were found dead.

00:20:57.507 --> 00:21:00.134
MURDER IN MIYAMA TOWN

00:21:00.218 --> 00:21:02.971
all victims were murdered
with a sharp blade-like object.

00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:03.888
The police...

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:19.404
Emiya...

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:20.947
Emiya!

00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:22.407
Emiya!

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:25.743
Morning, Emiya.

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:28.371
Morning, Mitsuzuri.

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:31.749
STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM

00:21:31.749 --> 00:21:34.252
Emiya, have you heard about the murder
in Miyama Town last night?

00:21:35.753 --> 00:21:37.380
A murder?

00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:39.507
Was the murderer caught?

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:41.592
No, not yet.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:47.265
Looks like I'll have to have all clubs
cancel their activities after school.

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:49.851
Excuse me.

00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:52.603
Ryudou, you have a moment?

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:54.188
Oh, sure!

00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:58.443
Sorry, Emiya. Let's continue
this talk at another time.

00:22:24.177 --> 00:22:26.012
What's up, Emiya?

00:22:26.429 --> 00:22:28.890
This is a classroom for the first-years.

00:22:29.307 --> 00:22:30.725
What are you doing here?

00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:34.520
Shinji, I thought
you didn't have practice today?

00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:40.651
Even without practice, I'm busy
with all sorts of things, you know?

00:22:41.027 --> 00:22:42.904
Oh, if you're up for it, you can-

00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:44.906
Don't trouble Mitsuzuri too much.

00:22:47.283 --> 00:22:48.534
What's up with that?

00:22:48.951 --> 00:22:51.662
I don't want an outsider telling me that.

00:22:55.416 --> 00:22:57.460
Oh, that's right, Emiya!

00:22:57.877 --> 00:23:00.755
Can I ask you to do something for me, too?

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:02.924
Sure. What is it?

00:23:03.007 --> 00:23:07.095
Stupid cleanup work
for the stupid archery club!

00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:12.934
Isn't that your job?

00:23:13.768 --> 00:23:17.313
I told you, I have other things to do.

00:23:17.563 --> 00:23:18.940
You have plenty of time, right?

00:23:19.816 --> 00:23:21.609
Then help me out here...

00:23:23.236 --> 00:23:24.237
Emiya.

00:23:28.783 --> 00:23:29.784
All right.

00:23:30.034 --> 00:23:31.285
I don't mind.

00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:37.625
Oh, fine.

00:23:38.209 --> 00:23:41.087
Then, why don't you do
what I said, Mr. Nice Guy?

00:23:45.758 --> 00:23:50.096
All after-school club meetings
have been canceled today.

00:23:50.513 --> 00:23:55.810
All faculty and students
must leave campus by 6PM.

00:23:57.145 --> 00:23:58.813
Now, let's go home.

00:23:59.313 --> 00:24:00.314
Okay!

00:24:01.399 --> 00:24:02.483
Then, see you later!

00:24:02.733 --> 00:24:03.734
See you later!

00:24:06.446 --> 00:24:08.322
Hey, let's check out that shop!

00:24:08.448 --> 00:24:10.283
Sure! I wanted to go there, too!

00:24:10.366 --> 00:24:11.826
Let's go!

00:24:34.891 --> 00:24:37.393
Guess I was too into cleaning.

00:25:01.292 --> 00:25:02.543
I should go home.

00:25:11.886 --> 00:25:12.970
What the...

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.754
Who's there?

00:25:52.969 --> 00:25:55.638
What was that?
What the hell was that?

00:25:56.556 --> 00:25:57.557
I gotta get out!

00:25:58.641 --> 00:25:59.725
If I don't,

00:26:00.518 --> 00:26:01.310
I'll die!

00:26:30.673 --> 00:26:31.716
Hey, there.

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.937
So deplorable.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:13.734
All too premature.
All too poor a summons.

00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:19.949
We have all the players,

00:28:20.199 --> 00:28:24.453
but the quality of the players
and the precision of the stage are lacking.

00:28:25.121 --> 00:28:31.836
This Holy Grail War is a far cry
from the grand ritual we sought.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.297
However,

00:28:35.923 --> 00:28:39.969
we cannot cancel something
that has already begun.

00:28:41.971 --> 00:28:47.268
If the goblet gets filled with water,
someone must drink it all up.

00:28:52.106 --> 00:28:56.318
Fortunately, that man
is the overseer from the church.

00:28:57.361 --> 00:29:01.991
He will surely be able to mediate
this distorted Holy Grail War well.

00:29:04.368 --> 00:29:06.620
The Holy Grail calls forth the Heroic Spirits,

00:29:06.704 --> 00:29:09.790
and the Heroic Spirits are in need of those
to make pacts with.

00:29:10.541 --> 00:29:13.878
If they are roped into this ritual,

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:17.882
it is destiny that they kill each other,
no matter who it is.

00:29:19.258 --> 00:29:23.888
Most importantly,
only one needs to be the last standing.

00:29:26.223 --> 00:29:29.727
The seventh Servant
who was summoned...

00:29:30.311 --> 00:29:31.729
is that Saber.

00:29:32.813 --> 00:29:36.066
And the Master is Emiya's son, huh?

00:29:37.568 --> 00:29:40.571
How strange fate can be...

00:29:42.907 --> 00:29:46.577
The Holy Church is an impenetrable area.
No one can meddle with them.

00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:48.037
But...

00:29:48.496 --> 00:29:55.795
will that man be a saint
fit to speak of gospel, or not?

00:30:15.397 --> 00:30:17.316
Are you coming or what, Emiya?

00:30:23.322 --> 00:30:28.661
I don't know why a half-baked Mage like you
was chosen for a Master.

00:30:30.037 --> 00:30:34.124
But the guy we're about to meet
will explain the Holy Grail War to you.

00:30:34.708 --> 00:30:37.545
Though, he's quite the despicable figure.

00:30:45.553 --> 00:30:48.889
You never accepted my repeated invitations,

00:30:49.849 --> 00:30:52.434
and now here you are with an odd guest.

00:30:56.605 --> 00:30:59.567
I take it this means that he is the seventh?

00:31:00.693 --> 00:31:02.862
I am Kirei Kotomine.

00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:07.116
I am in charge of this church.

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:12.872
Shirou Emiya, huh?

00:31:13.497 --> 00:31:16.584
I take it, then,
that you are Saber's Master?

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:21.213
It's true that Saber has saved my life.

00:31:22.965 --> 00:31:27.011
But if a Master is supposed to be
a proper mage,

00:31:27.261 --> 00:31:29.013
you really ought to pick somebody else.

00:31:29.388 --> 00:31:31.765
Choose a new Master, you say?

00:31:34.435 --> 00:31:36.103
I see.

00:31:36.812 --> 00:31:42.359
Then you also have no interest
in the events of ten years ago?

00:31:43.569 --> 00:31:47.907
The Holy Grail is the omnipotent power
in the world of Magecraft.

00:31:48.157 --> 00:31:51.327
It is a granter of wishes
that can grant any and every wish.

00:31:51.619 --> 00:31:53.454
In order to obtain this,

00:31:53.787 --> 00:31:57.708
the chosen Masters fought
and killed each other.

00:31:58.417 --> 00:32:02.171
As a result, one unfortunate accident
was triggered.

00:32:02.504 --> 00:32:05.049
One that you could call a catastrophe.

00:32:08.093 --> 00:32:09.136
Impossible!

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:10.471
That was...

00:32:11.639 --> 00:32:12.806
That's right.

00:32:13.474 --> 00:32:17.186
Everyone who lives in this city knows.

00:32:17.478 --> 00:32:23.317
Five hundred casualties.
As many as 134 structures burned down.

00:32:23.567 --> 00:32:27.947
That fire whose cause
remains unknown to this day

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.325
is the aftermath of the Holy Grail War.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:34.411
Emiya?

00:32:35.955 --> 00:32:39.333
Kirei, I told you
to explain the rules to him!

00:32:39.416 --> 00:32:41.126
I didn't tell you to open his wounds!

00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:51.095
So is that Holy Grail thing for real?

00:32:51.804 --> 00:32:52.805
Last time,

00:32:53.055 --> 00:32:56.809
there was a man who momentarily
obtained the Grail.

00:32:57.518 --> 00:32:59.228
What happened to him?

00:33:00.145 --> 00:33:01.522
Nothing.

00:33:02.231 --> 00:33:05.567
That Grail did not achieve completion.

00:33:06.026 --> 00:33:11.699
That is Why this man who avoided fighting
did not win the Grail.

00:33:12.366 --> 00:33:15.452
You sound like you've seen it or something.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:20.916
I did see it.

00:33:22.418 --> 00:33:27.673
I fought for the Holy Grail last time
as one of the Masters.

00:33:27.756 --> 00:33:29.883
Wait! Is that true?

00:33:30.467 --> 00:33:32.886
I did fight until about halfway.

00:33:33.095 --> 00:33:35.222
But I made the wrong decision.

00:33:36.348 --> 00:33:41.395
As a result, I was only able to hold
an empty Holy Grail.

00:33:41.603 --> 00:33:42.771
What does that-

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:46.775
We're in the middle of our talk,

00:33:47.776 --> 00:33:50.446
but it seems we have an impatient guest.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:00.414
Hey, do you know of the name "Einzbern"?

00:34:03.333 --> 00:34:04.585
Now then, young man...

00:34:05.252 --> 00:34:06.837
There is no time.

00:34:07.379 --> 00:34:09.089
Let's hear your decision.

00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:10.340
Emiya!

00:34:14.261 --> 00:34:18.849
If the Holy Grail War
was what caused the fire ten years ago,

00:34:20.267 --> 00:34:21.268
I...

00:34:29.276 --> 00:34:30.360
I'll fight.

00:34:31.195 --> 00:34:33.113
I'll fight as a Master!

00:34:36.784 --> 00:34:38.535
Rejoice, boy.

00:34:39.328 --> 00:34:41.955
Your wish will at last come true.

00:34:44.124 --> 00:34:48.712
A hero of justice must have
a villain to defeat.

00:34:55.177 --> 00:34:58.222
There's no way a Servant would remember.

00:35:02.518 --> 00:35:04.478
Are you done with your chitchat?

00:35:10.234 --> 00:35:12.319
Good evening, Big Brother.

00:35:12.736 --> 00:35:14.196
I'm Illya.

00:35:15.489 --> 00:35:18.075
Illyasviel von Einzbern.

00:35:25.958 --> 00:35:27.960
Thanks for being so courteous.

00:35:28.961 --> 00:35:30.712
Okay, I'm gonna kill you now.

00:35:31.713 --> 00:35:34.341
Get them, Berserker!

00:36:01.034 --> 00:36:02.077
Saber!

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:08.750
Run.

00:36:16.133 --> 00:36:17.301
Please, run!

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:21.930
When Archer isn't here!

00:36:22.055 --> 00:36:23.891
Very good, Berserker!

00:36:24.224 --> 00:36:26.143
She regenerates,

00:36:26.393 --> 00:36:29.062
so behead her first and violate her!

00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:53.670
I am...

00:36:54.922 --> 00:36:56.006
a fool!

00:36:58.675 --> 00:36:59.718
Hold it!

00:37:34.753 --> 00:37:35.754
No way.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:37.631
Why?

00:37:39.258 --> 00:37:41.885
This is so boring.

00:37:42.928 --> 00:37:43.762
Master!

00:37:43.971 --> 00:37:46.348
Oh, jeez, why did you-

00:37:56.483 --> 00:37:57.693
When I was little,

00:37:58.819 --> 00:38:01.905
I admired a hero of justice.

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:08.245
You can only be a hero for a limited time.

00:38:08.912 --> 00:38:10.163
Once you become an adult,

00:38:10.747 --> 00:38:12.666
it's harder to claim to be one.

00:38:15.127 --> 00:38:16.253
Kiritsugu...

00:38:18.422 --> 00:38:19.256
Besides,

00:38:20.048 --> 00:38:22.259
to side with someone means

00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:26.430
that you're not on the side of someone else.

00:38:29.224 --> 00:38:30.434
What in the world

00:38:31.268 --> 00:38:35.022
do I have to do
to become a hero of justice?

00:38:46.533 --> 00:38:47.492
Huh?

00:38:47.868 --> 00:38:49.453
I'm all healed!

00:38:50.495 --> 00:38:51.371
Master...

00:38:52.956 --> 00:38:54.374
Are you all right?

00:38:57.169 --> 00:38:58.545
Are you awake now?

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:01.381
Tohsaka!

00:39:02.341 --> 00:39:04.092
You did this, Tohsaka?

00:39:04.593 --> 00:39:05.469
No.

00:39:05.719 --> 00:39:08.430
You healed those wounds
with your own powers, Master.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.476
No way! I can't do something like this.

00:39:12.768 --> 00:39:16.897
Then perhaps your pact with Saber
has some kind of influence on you.

00:39:19.316 --> 00:39:20.650
First off...

00:39:21.068 --> 00:39:24.237
let's hear an explanation
about the incident earlier!

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:27.949
I didn't do anything particularly wrong.

00:39:28.784 --> 00:39:30.577
Actually, I was going to do better-

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:35.415
We Servants exist thanks to Masters
supplying us with magical energy.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:39.878
If that goes away, we are no longer
able to remain over here!

00:39:40.504 --> 00:39:42.798
I-I see.

00:39:43.048 --> 00:39:44.299
That's right.

00:39:45.133 --> 00:39:47.177
I'll be going now.

00:39:47.552 --> 00:39:51.056
I have to heal my own Servant, too.

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:57.938
Oh, and the next time I see you,
we're enemies!

00:40:04.694 --> 00:40:07.739
She's a good person.

00:40:12.327 --> 00:40:14.955
Saber, are your wounds all right?

00:40:15.747 --> 00:40:16.498
Yes.

00:40:16.748 --> 00:40:18.792
Though it's a far cry from being perfect.

00:40:25.424 --> 00:40:26.258
Um...

00:40:26.883 --> 00:40:29.553
Saber, do you want the Holy Grail, too?

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:33.306
Yes. That is Why I am here right now.

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:40.856
Berserker's Master said
her name was Einzbern.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.027
Such a child is participating, as well?

00:40:49.614 --> 00:40:50.574
Saber?

00:40:53.076 --> 00:40:56.121
Someone is using Magecraft.

00:40:56.955 --> 00:40:58.999
But it isn't the presence of Berserker.

00:40:59.666 --> 00:41:01.501
It is the presence of something different.

00:41:01.835 --> 00:41:03.712
Master, your orders!

00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:10.760
Let's go!

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.190
Please be careful.

00:41:23.565 --> 00:41:25.066
A barrier has been put up.

00:41:26.943 --> 00:41:28.361
I know this feeling...

00:41:28.737 --> 00:41:29.988
I've felt it somewhere.

00:41:52.594 --> 00:41:53.678
Mitsuzuri?

00:42:09.653 --> 00:42:10.904
Mitsuzuri!

00:42:14.741 --> 00:42:16.535
What a surprise.

00:42:16.785 --> 00:42:20.163
I was wondering who...
and it's you, Emiya!

00:42:22.541 --> 00:42:23.458
Why?

00:42:24.543 --> 00:42:26.628
Oh, that's right.

00:42:27.087 --> 00:42:32.175
I had the captain of our archery club
help me out a bit.

00:42:35.136 --> 00:42:36.513
Shinji!

00:42:38.348 --> 00:42:41.268
Is that your Servant?

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:48.441
Let me introduce someone to you!

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:51.444
This is my Servant.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.698
Hey, let's have them
fight each other, Emiya.

00:42:55.115 --> 00:42:58.535
I've always wanted to see
a battle between Servants!

00:43:00.495 --> 00:43:01.580
Shinji,

00:43:01.913 --> 00:43:04.291
why the hell did you become a Master?

00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:09.170
The Matous are an old,
distinguished family of mages.

00:43:09.546 --> 00:43:11.256
When it comes to the Holy Grail War,

00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:13.550
they're even said to be
one of the Three Great Families.

00:43:13.967 --> 00:43:19.055
Though, I didn't want an amateur
like you to find out.

00:43:20.098 --> 00:43:22.642
And it's only natural for me,
the firstborn son...

00:43:24.686 --> 00:43:28.732
to participate
in the Holy Grail War, isn't it?

00:43:28.982 --> 00:43:29.899
Shinji!

00:43:30.191 --> 00:43:32.485
You're not getting it at all, as always!

00:43:32.986 --> 00:43:34.821
You already understand, don't you?

00:43:35.488 --> 00:43:41.161
That this game is one
that is a little bit more serious!

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.258
Go, Rider!

00:44:24.371 --> 00:44:25.538
Well...

00:44:47.394 --> 00:44:48.228
Hey...

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.189
Who said you were allowed
to be defeated?

00:44:52.774 --> 00:44:53.650
Stand up!

00:44:57.737 --> 00:44:58.571
Stand.

00:44:59.447 --> 00:45:00.657
Stand up!

00:45:02.117 --> 00:45:05.912
Otherwise, you'd make me look like a loser!

00:45:12.168 --> 00:45:13.420
Why?

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.589
Dammit! Go out! Go out!

00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:17.757
Go ou-

00:45:27.392 --> 00:45:28.351
Shinji...

00:45:29.436 --> 00:45:33.732
It seems this was too much for you, Shinji.

00:45:42.574 --> 00:45:45.452
And now the Matous have been defeated.

00:45:45.952 --> 00:45:48.121
A bitter disappointment.

00:45:48.621 --> 00:45:49.622
You are...

00:45:49.914 --> 00:45:52.250
G-Grandfather! P-Please wait!

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.669
I am the mage of the Matou family!

00:45:55.086 --> 00:45:56.004
I am!

00:45:58.548 --> 00:46:02.051
An incompetent fool
is incompetent in every way.

00:46:02.802 --> 00:46:05.555
The bloodline of the Matous
has fallen to the ground.

00:46:06.389 --> 00:46:10.185
I have not one expectation from you.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:14.564
"From you"?

00:46:15.273 --> 00:46:16.608
Wait, please wait!

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.694
Is Sakura forced to do
something like this, as well?

00:46:21.863 --> 00:46:25.700
Why did you bring up her name now?

00:46:26.159 --> 00:46:27.827
I'm the one!

00:46:28.495 --> 00:46:32.207
That scum can't possibly know Magecraft!

00:46:32.457 --> 00:46:36.085
The teachings of Matou were all mine!

00:46:55.396 --> 00:46:56.272
Mitsuzuri!

00:47:00.151 --> 00:47:02.529
As she is a victim of the Holy Grail War,

00:47:02.821 --> 00:47:05.532
the proper way is to ask the overseer for help.

00:47:21.089 --> 00:47:22.340
Honestly...

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:25.343
To think you'd return in a matter of hours...

00:47:32.433 --> 00:47:33.685
Interesting.

00:47:34.018 --> 00:47:37.063
You are spellbound
by something not so good.

00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:44.696
I'll hold onto her for a while.

00:48:01.671 --> 00:48:02.922
You were still here?

00:48:03.464 --> 00:48:04.591
What about Mitsuzuri?

00:48:05.341 --> 00:48:07.135
I finished all treatments.

00:48:07.552 --> 00:48:09.012
No need to worry.

00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:14.225
More so, you seem to be worse off...

00:48:16.978 --> 00:48:18.938
I-I'm healed already.

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:24.277
In the battle ten years ago,

00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:27.739
I faced a man
who kept standing before me

00:48:27.822 --> 00:48:30.742
even after suffering fatal wounds,
just like you.

00:48:31.576 --> 00:48:34.621
That man was the last one whom I fought,

00:48:34.871 --> 00:48:39.709
and the man who became the winner
of the previous Holy Grail War.

00:48:41.252 --> 00:48:42.462
His name was...

00:48:43.129 --> 00:48:45.214
Kiritsugu Emiya.

00:48:51.471 --> 00:48:52.430
Saber!

00:48:54.766 --> 00:48:56.476
Mitsuzuri has been saved.

00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:57.769
I'm glad.

00:48:58.269 --> 00:49:00.355
That took quite a while.

00:49:00.897 --> 00:49:01.731
Yeah.

00:49:03.816 --> 00:49:06.611
I was asking him about Kiritsugu.

00:49:07.153 --> 00:49:08.655
About Dad.

00:49:14.202 --> 00:49:15.161
Master...

00:49:18.206 --> 00:49:21.626
There is something
I must talk to you about.

00:49:23.002 --> 00:49:28.424
The man Kiritsugu Emiya,
in a word, was an assassin.

00:49:28.925 --> 00:49:34.222
He was a mage-killer, who made a living
specializing in assassinating mages.

00:49:34.639 --> 00:49:38.142
All mages are outlaws who have strayed
from the path of virtue,

00:49:38.393 --> 00:49:41.771
but even among them,
he was quite an anomaly.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.775
I was beckoned to this era
last time, as well,

00:49:46.234 --> 00:49:48.695
and I fought as a Servant for Einzbern.

00:49:49.862 --> 00:49:53.241
Back then, my Master's name
was Kiritsugu Emiya.

00:49:54.283 --> 00:49:55.076
However...

00:49:55.451 --> 00:49:58.705
Truly one with no blood nor tears.

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:03.084
He justified any method if it meant victory,

00:50:03.334 --> 00:50:07.422
and annihilated any Master,
even those who begged for their lives.

00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:13.052
Among them all, Kiritsugu found
that priest to be the greatest foe.

00:50:14.429 --> 00:50:16.014
He and I...

00:50:16.389 --> 00:50:22.395
I guess you could say we only had
the option of killing each other.

00:50:23.229 --> 00:50:26.524
He and I challenged ourselves
to the Holy Grail War,

00:50:26.774 --> 00:50:28.693
and were victorious until the very end.

00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:31.154
However...

00:50:31.612 --> 00:50:34.907
Kiritsugu Emiya betrayed the Holy Grail

00:50:35.366 --> 00:50:37.160
at the very, very end!

00:50:37.785 --> 00:50:41.330
I destroyed the Holy Grail.

00:50:49.338 --> 00:50:52.341
He killed one to let ten live.

00:50:52.717 --> 00:50:56.763
He was an incorrigible saint.

00:51:17.366 --> 00:51:18.451
Still...

00:51:19.535 --> 00:51:21.245
If it's the Kiritsugu I know,

00:51:21.621 --> 00:51:25.374
he wouldn't abandon anyone
who's fallen victim to the Holy Grail War.

00:51:26.751 --> 00:51:30.463
He's the kind of hero of justice
I've looked up to.

00:51:32.256 --> 00:51:34.175
So that's why I'm going to fight.

00:51:35.676 --> 00:51:37.428
I'm sorry I'm a bit late,

00:51:37.887 --> 00:51:41.349
but Saber, I want you
to fight together with me.

00:51:43.935 --> 00:51:46.229
No matter what has happened in my past,

00:51:46.562 --> 00:51:50.441
the engraved Command Seal of yours
binds me to you, my current Master.

00:51:52.235 --> 00:51:53.361
Yeah.

00:51:53.736 --> 00:51:56.614
If you don't mind, please call me Shirou.

00:51:58.699 --> 00:52:00.868
Then, Shirou it is.

00:52:02.411 --> 00:52:03.246
Yes.

00:52:03.704 --> 00:52:06.165
I prefer this way of saying it.

00:52:08.251 --> 00:52:09.252
Thank you.

00:52:13.214 --> 00:52:14.882
Then, shall we go home?

00:52:15.466 --> 00:52:16.342
Sure.

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:25.518
Oh, so you're an acquaintance of Kiritsugu's!

00:52:26.602 --> 00:52:29.689
But what a tragedy
that your luggage hasn't arrived!

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:33.651
I'm sorry it's a hand-me-down
from Shirou, Saber.

00:52:34.277 --> 00:52:36.487
No, please don't worry about it.

00:52:36.571 --> 00:52:39.448
Kiritsugu was such a sinful man!

00:52:39.699 --> 00:52:42.201
I knew he went overseas often.

00:52:42.618 --> 00:52:46.080
Hey, I want to hear some of the memories
you have about Kiritsugu!

00:52:47.665 --> 00:52:49.792
Well, that's...

00:52:50.126 --> 00:52:52.920
Sorry about this, Sakura.
It was a sudden thing.

00:52:53.212 --> 00:52:54.046
No.

00:52:54.755 --> 00:52:55.882
Anyway...

00:52:56.132 --> 00:52:57.008
Um...

00:52:57.675 --> 00:52:59.886
Did you see Shinji this morning?

00:53:02.305 --> 00:53:03.181
Yes.

00:53:03.514 --> 00:53:05.391
What of it?

00:53:05.683 --> 00:53:08.269
No, it's fine if nothing is wrong.

00:53:13.399 --> 00:53:14.358
Sakura.

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:17.153
U-Um... Senpai?

00:53:21.324 --> 00:53:22.366
Sakura...

00:53:22.867 --> 00:53:23.784
This...

00:53:26.787 --> 00:53:27.997
Did Shinji do it?

00:53:42.345 --> 00:53:43.346
Emiya...

00:53:45.181 --> 00:53:49.810
What nerve to come to school
without your Servant.

00:53:50.436 --> 00:53:53.064
That's right, if you think too lightly of me-

00:53:54.106 --> 00:53:56.025
Wh-What?

00:53:59.987 --> 00:54:03.032
For goodness' sake, Tohsaka,
please give me some advice!

00:54:03.532 --> 00:54:04.283
What?

00:54:04.784 --> 00:54:06.452
Wh-What?

00:54:09.121 --> 00:54:09.997
I see.

00:54:10.539 --> 00:54:14.210
Shinji was a Master,
and Ayako got roped in.

00:54:14.543 --> 00:54:16.754
And Rider is now gone.

00:54:22.385 --> 00:54:25.429
And this can't possibly be everything, can it?

00:54:32.311 --> 00:54:34.730
Shinji has a little sister.

00:54:35.106 --> 00:54:36.482
Her name is Sakura.

00:54:40.361 --> 00:54:41.988
What about her?

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:46.325
Sakura might get involved in this!

00:54:46.784 --> 00:54:50.746
Shinji didn't seem like he'd given up yet.

00:54:51.831 --> 00:54:53.207
At this rate...

00:54:54.625 --> 00:54:55.459
Then...

00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.671
Why don't you keep her safe at your place?

00:55:03.843 --> 00:55:05.136
That is,

00:55:05.636 --> 00:55:09.015
if you're saying
she's an important person to you.

00:55:25.448 --> 00:55:26.407
Sakura...

00:55:28.242 --> 00:55:31.245
The breakfast this morning
was truly delicious.

00:55:31.954 --> 00:55:34.623
And you made lunch for me, as well.

00:55:35.624 --> 00:55:37.084
I am truly grateful to you.

00:55:38.336 --> 00:55:40.254
Well, u-um...

00:55:40.838 --> 00:55:44.800
And so, I would like to help you out
in some way.

00:55:46.886 --> 00:55:49.180
W-Well...

00:55:52.808 --> 00:55:54.310
You can do it!

00:55:57.313 --> 00:56:00.399
W-Well, then...

00:56:02.068 --> 00:56:02.985
I'm home!

00:56:04.987 --> 00:56:06.322
Here!

00:56:06.864 --> 00:56:09.116
I thought you might need
all sorts of things.

00:56:09.533 --> 00:56:11.202
Oh, Saber, this...

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:15.790
Um, your luggage had arrived.

00:56:17.166 --> 00:56:18.793
Oh, so cute!

00:56:19.919 --> 00:56:23.798
Really! I keep owing Tohsaka favors!

00:56:24.423 --> 00:56:25.508
Senpai...

00:56:27.218 --> 00:56:30.304
I understand you need sundries,

00:56:30.596 --> 00:56:33.307
but it seems you have quite a bit...

00:56:33.641 --> 00:56:34.683
Oh, that's right.

00:56:35.184 --> 00:56:36.102
Fuji-nee...

00:56:36.519 --> 00:56:40.481
We should have Sakura sleep over
at our place for a while starting today.

00:56:42.024 --> 00:56:45.236
Shirou, what brought this up all of a sudden?

00:56:45.736 --> 00:56:47.738
It's pretty dangerous
out there lately, isn't it?

00:56:47.988 --> 00:56:52.368
Looks like Shinji is pretty busy
and doesn't go home much, either.

00:56:53.953 --> 00:56:54.870
Sakura?

00:56:56.872 --> 00:56:58.082
Um...

00:57:02.336 --> 00:57:03.671
I-I know!

00:57:04.588 --> 00:57:08.509
I'll go get Saber's room ready.

00:57:10.136 --> 00:57:11.011
Ouch!

00:57:12.388 --> 00:57:13.514
I'll go with you.

00:57:18.727 --> 00:57:24.775
You didn't want Sakura to misunderstand
having Saber sleeping over?

00:57:25.192 --> 00:57:27.361
What made you think that way?

00:57:30.281 --> 00:57:32.158
Sakura...

00:57:32.658 --> 00:57:35.035
apparently has E-cups!

00:57:36.412 --> 00:57:38.747
What are you talking about?

00:57:42.543 --> 00:57:44.587
Shirou! Sakura is...

00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:57.349
Senpai?

00:57:58.476 --> 00:58:00.102
I'm sorry.

00:58:00.478 --> 00:58:02.354
This has already come in handy.

00:58:11.739 --> 00:58:13.324
I'll be here a while longer.

00:58:13.782 --> 00:58:16.076
I'll be monitoring you
for 30 more minutes,

00:58:16.327 --> 00:58:17.953
so you stay quiet here.

00:58:21.707 --> 00:58:22.625
Yes.

00:58:23.042 --> 00:58:26.253
Well then, I trust you with the monitoring.

00:58:32.885 --> 00:58:34.011
Senpai...

00:58:35.846 --> 00:58:38.224
About what you said earlier...

00:58:38.724 --> 00:58:42.228
Um, about how I can stay here...

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.979
Why is that?

00:58:45.064 --> 00:58:46.315
Are you...

00:58:46.774 --> 00:58:48.817
worried about me?

00:58:50.486 --> 00:58:51.403
Yeah.

00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:53.697
I'm worried about you, Sakura.

00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:58.160
That's why it would help me a lot
if you could stay here.

00:59:01.205 --> 00:59:02.289
Well,

00:59:02.873 --> 00:59:04.458
I will stay here then.

00:59:05.626 --> 00:59:06.544
Yeah.

00:59:24.395 --> 00:59:25.604
I didn't expect...

00:59:26.105 --> 00:59:29.024
something so abhorred...

01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:04.977
Souichiro? Is something the matter?

01:00:08.397 --> 01:00:10.024
Stay here with the others.

01:00:12.985 --> 01:00:15.571
Assassin, come hither!

01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:17.948
Assassin!

01:00:43.599 --> 01:00:47.061
Master... Souichiro...

01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:56.528
This man, what is he?

01:00:57.905 --> 01:01:00.532
First, I cut his head.

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:02.701
Arms, legs...

01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:04.036
I cut them.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.289
Belly, I sliced open.

01:01:08.123 --> 01:01:08.999
But...

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.918
he moved.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:13.629
You're the true Assassin?

01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:24.890
Unleash me, witch.

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:51.917
Are you satisfied now?

01:02:52.853 --> 01:02:54.021
Emiya...

01:02:59.318 --> 01:03:00.486
Hey.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.529
It's fine.

01:03:03.572 --> 01:03:05.032
Emiya...

01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:08.577
Do as you wish.

01:03:18.796 --> 01:03:20.672
Toh... saka...

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:36.688
Um...

01:03:37.564 --> 01:03:38.899
Senpai...

01:03:47.783 --> 01:03:49.868
That's no good!

01:03:51.078 --> 01:03:53.872
ANOTHER GAS LEAK IN NEW CITY'S OFFICE DISTRICT

01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:57.876
there was another gas leak in a building
in the New City district of Fuyuki.

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:02.256
The building that had the gas leak last night
is on the east side of the New City Station.

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:06.051
The security guard and several office workers
who were inside the building

01:04:06.134 --> 01:04:07.678
were seriously ill and found comatose.

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:10.681
Damage, as in the previous gas leak,
has been reported where several dozen people

01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:13.058
who were close to the building or nearby
restaurants have reported feeling ill...

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:14.768
Hello?

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.979
Oh, it's you, Fuji-nee.

01:04:19.147 --> 01:04:20.899
I see, you can't come today.

01:04:21.233 --> 01:04:22.109
Yeah.

01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:24.403
What?

01:04:24.528 --> 01:04:28.282
MR. ISSEI RYUDOU
MR. TARO SUZUKI
MR. NAOKI TAKADA

01:04:48.135 --> 01:04:50.387
I went to Ryudou Temple last night.

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:54.600
From the comatose incident in New City...

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:57.936
the flow of magical energy
was headed to Ryudou Temple.

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:02.232
Archer has recovered,
so I thought I'd at least check it out.

01:05:03.984 --> 01:05:05.569
Conclusions first.

01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:08.989
It was Caster who was using
Ryudou Temple as her stronghold.

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:13.827
But when I went there,

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:17.247
Caster was already snuffed out
by someone.

01:05:18.123 --> 01:05:21.793
The temple residents were stripped
of their magical energy, and found comatose.

01:05:22.044 --> 01:05:23.253
And...

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:26.048
the only one murdered was Mr. Kuzuki.

01:05:27.174 --> 01:05:29.509
He was most likely Caster's Master.

01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:39.811
Now, the main subject...

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:43.482
There was another comatose incident
in New City this morning.

01:05:44.942 --> 01:05:47.819
Despite Caster already being gone, huh?

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.290
Sakura ended up over at your place, right?

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:01.500
Huh?

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:05.170
Yeah. She's been sleeping
over at my place since last night.

01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:11.259
Emiya, why don't we fight together?

01:06:11.802 --> 01:06:12.761
Huh?

01:06:13.095 --> 01:06:14.346
It seems this time around,

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:17.391
things are a lot different
than what I'd heard from my father.

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:21.436
So first, I want to make it clear
as to what is going on.

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:25.524
Fighting together for a limited time...

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:28.276
Yes, that's what this means.

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:39.079
Rin...

01:06:40.247 --> 01:06:44.751
I feel that fighting together
with a powerless Master is meaningless.

01:06:45.252 --> 01:06:46.336
What was that?

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.922
Did I say something that was incorrect?

01:06:50.132 --> 01:06:53.677
Archer, I'll have you
follow your Master's morals.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:57.431
So losing no time...

01:06:57.973 --> 01:06:59.391
Can you come out tonight?

01:07:05.105 --> 01:07:07.190
Fighting together with Archer's Master?

01:07:08.817 --> 01:07:11.695
Yeah. I'm sorry it's so sudden.

01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:13.071
It's fine.

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:16.700
Besides, if we finish
the Holy Grail War quickly,

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:19.828
Sakura will be able to return
to normal life.

01:07:21.997 --> 01:07:26.001
Shirou, perhaps Sakura
really is not feeling well.

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:27.210
Huh?

01:07:27.294 --> 01:07:28.879
Oh, nothing.

01:07:29.337 --> 01:07:31.715
I hope it is just me.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:41.850
Sakura, is someone here?

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:59.743
What? Emiya, I'm Sakura's big brother.

01:08:00.077 --> 01:08:03.538
What's Wrong with me coming
to take my dearest sister back home?

01:08:08.794 --> 01:08:11.004
What big brother punches his little sister?

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:14.800
You roped Mitsuzuri into this!

01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.927
I can't trust you with Sakura!

01:08:18.095 --> 01:08:19.721
Oh, I see.

01:08:20.138 --> 01:08:22.057
You got your hands on her
after what happened.

01:08:22.724 --> 01:08:25.644
And you don't want to let her go
because you haven't had her enough.

01:08:25.936 --> 01:08:27.145
Damn you!

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:30.899
Senpai!

01:08:36.947 --> 01:08:38.657
Shinji!

01:08:39.491 --> 01:08:41.868
That look on your face is so good.

01:08:42.661 --> 01:08:44.996
C'mon! Let's continue from the other day!

01:08:46.373 --> 01:08:47.833
Stop it, Big Brother!

01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:52.212
Sakura...

01:08:52.963 --> 01:08:55.090
I'll do anything you tell me to.

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:58.593
Please, just not in front of Senpai!

01:09:07.144 --> 01:09:12.440
Sakura, don't you ever forget
what you just said.

01:09:18.655 --> 01:09:19.823
Senpai...

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:22.117
I'm sorry!

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:26.663
It's not something
you need to apologize for, Sakura.

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:04.534
No good. I'm not concentrating.

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:10.790
Senpai?

01:10:11.249 --> 01:10:12.375
Are you here?

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:15.503
Is that you, Sakura?

01:10:25.055 --> 01:10:25.931
Um...

01:10:27.224 --> 01:10:28.308
Can we...

01:10:29.017 --> 01:10:30.894
chat for a while?

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:35.106
Y-Yeah.

01:10:45.784 --> 01:10:46.826
Um...

01:10:47.327 --> 01:10:48.370
About earlier...

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:50.789
I'm sorry about what Big Brother did.

01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:53.917
I said, don't worry about it.

01:11:01.341 --> 01:11:02.717
It's cold in here, isn't it?

01:11:02.968 --> 01:11:04.219
Hold on a second!

01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:06.471
There!

01:11:09.975 --> 01:11:10.767
Sakura.

01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:22.445
So warm!

01:11:23.363 --> 01:11:25.573
So this was fixed?

01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:27.117
Yeah.

01:11:27.701 --> 01:11:29.995
It took quite a while to fix, though.

01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:38.086
Senpai, do you remember?

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.382
It's a story from a long time ago.

01:11:43.133 --> 01:11:44.509
A story...

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:48.305
from back when I didn't know you.

01:11:50.724 --> 01:11:52.934
It was a bright red sunset.

01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:57.147
The school courtyard, the hallway...
Everything was all red.

01:11:57.689 --> 01:11:59.774
It was beautiful, yet lonely.

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:07.198
And then there was one person
high-jumping alone in the courtyard.

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:13.830
And back then, I wasn't a very good girl.

01:12:14.748 --> 01:12:16.624
As I watched that person,

01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:20.628
I kept thinking he should just screw up.

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:24.007
But...

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:44.110
No matter how many times he tried,
he couldn't make the jump.

01:12:44.652 --> 01:12:48.114
He came to accept that he couldn't jump,

01:12:48.615 --> 01:12:50.992
cleaned up and went home.

01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:56.790
Sakura, in other words, that's...

01:12:57.665 --> 01:12:58.500
Yes.

01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:01.961
He's the upperclassman
who's next to me right now.

01:13:03.463 --> 01:13:08.218
I'd known about you from back then.

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:13.681
I see. This is the first I've heard of it.

01:13:17.852 --> 01:13:19.854
Um, Senpai...

01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:24.651
Can I ask you something
that's really difficult to ask?

01:13:27.695 --> 01:13:30.657
I heard from Miss Fujimura

01:13:30.949 --> 01:13:35.537
that you were adopted into this family.

01:13:36.538 --> 01:13:37.288
Yeah.

01:13:37.539 --> 01:13:38.540
That's right.

01:13:39.374 --> 01:13:43.253
You don't mind that you were adopted?

01:13:44.129 --> 01:13:46.631
It took a while for me to get used to it,

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:49.092
but that was not something
I particularly cared for, right?

01:13:50.677 --> 01:13:54.973
Everyone around you must've been kind.

01:13:56.099 --> 01:14:00.186
In my case, everyone older than me
was so unreliable.

01:14:01.312 --> 01:14:03.982
Kiritsugu couldn't do housework at all,

01:14:04.732 --> 01:14:06.526
and you've seen how Fuji-nee is.

01:14:07.235 --> 01:14:12.073
So, as I've been doing housework,
I've become who I am now.

01:14:13.658 --> 01:14:17.120
But I wanted to be someone like Kiritsugu.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:25.211
Be a hero of justice, was it?

01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:36.306
Huh?

01:14:36.556 --> 01:14:37.891
That's strange.

01:14:42.479 --> 01:14:43.938
Senpai...

01:14:44.439 --> 01:14:46.065
I'll ask you one more question.

01:14:48.485 --> 01:14:54.616
If I became a bad person,
would you be able to forgive me?

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:01.498
No. If you do something bad,
I'll admonish you.

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:03.875
Stricter than anyone else.

01:15:07.545 --> 01:15:09.088
I'm glad.

01:15:10.298 --> 01:15:13.510
I'd be fine if it was you, Senpai.

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:19.682
I'll be going to sleep now.

01:15:20.225 --> 01:15:23.019
Good night, Senpai.

01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:47.585
Miyama HQ to all Miyama paramedics.

01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:51.172
Miyama HQ to all Miyama paramedics.
Call received from the center.

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:54.842
Many people need rescue in the building
across from New City Station.

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:59.138
All available vehicles
should promptly head on-site. Over.

01:15:59.806 --> 01:16:02.100
Miyama Paramedic 2 to Miyama HQ.

01:16:22.829 --> 01:16:23.663
Hey...

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:26.666
Was that your handiwork?

01:16:42.473 --> 01:16:47.687
No, a filthy little sand bug
wouldn't be able to pull off such a stunt.

01:17:22.055 --> 01:17:23.556
I'm not letting you get away.

01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:33.311
Come!

01:20:12.266 --> 01:20:13.309
Don't bother.

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:17.313
It's my nature.
Projectiles don't work against me.

01:20:19.482 --> 01:20:22.235
"Protection from Arrows," huh?

01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:28.616
Hiding weapons painted black
within the shadows...

01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:31.118
Such stupidity.

01:20:57.603 --> 01:21:02.066
You saw my face, did you, Lancer?

01:21:02.525 --> 01:21:04.235
Soon enough.

01:21:14.704 --> 01:21:16.247
Is this the destination?

01:21:17.623 --> 01:21:21.002
What is a sand bug going to do
in a watering hole, huh?

01:22:05.212 --> 01:22:08.341
If you don't move, it will swallow you.

01:22:08.758 --> 01:22:09.675
Damn you!

01:22:10.343 --> 01:22:12.678
Do you know what the hell this is?

01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:14.513
This is...

01:22:36.827 --> 01:22:37.870
Noble Phantasm...

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:41.916
Zabaniya!

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:55.429
Noble Phantasm!

01:22:55.763 --> 01:22:58.015
It's a bit far, but I'll settle it now!

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:03.896
Gae...

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:09.235
...Bolg!

01:23:17.702 --> 01:23:18.911
You...

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:21.122
lose!

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:21.223
Yeah, this is...

01:24:21.682 --> 01:24:23.934
the worst turn of events.

01:25:01.514 --> 01:25:02.932
Senpai!

01:25:16.445 --> 01:25:17.279
Tohsaka...

01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:19.907
Let's chat as we walk.

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:23.410
We're being monitored,
so be mindful of that.

01:25:33.546 --> 01:25:35.923
Can I assume that was all your doing,

01:25:36.465 --> 01:25:37.800
elder of Matou?

01:25:48.435 --> 01:25:50.771
Nothing less from Tohsaka's girl.

01:25:52.273 --> 01:25:54.608
Very good.

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:56.610
Zouken!

01:25:57.444 --> 01:25:59.613
I thought the Matous had been defeated?

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:07.204
I don't recall saying one word
about whether I myself had lost.

01:26:10.416 --> 01:26:11.166
Archer!

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:25.931
Bastard...

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:29.101
To toy with a Heroic Spirit's corpse...

01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:30.895
How could you?

01:26:43.324 --> 01:26:44.658
Saber! You can't!

01:26:44.742 --> 01:26:45.576
That sword...

01:26:50.873 --> 01:26:52.291
Don't touch that sword!

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:07.014
That sword must break Magecraft.

01:27:08.515 --> 01:27:10.976
I'm sure it can even sever pacts with Masters.

01:27:12.102 --> 01:27:13.270
Damn him!

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:19.777
I thought I should end this quickly.

01:27:40.089 --> 01:27:44.218
Indeed, this one's Magecraft
will likely not work against Saber.

01:27:44.468 --> 01:27:48.305
But what if it's with the Master in tow?

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:00.776
Impossible!

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:02.194
This cannot be!

01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:03.696
What?

01:28:04.071 --> 01:28:05.072
What is that?

01:28:05.531 --> 01:28:06.448
Tohsaka...

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:07.658
That thing...

01:28:08.325 --> 01:28:10.995
What is that thing?

01:28:41.567 --> 01:28:43.777
Imaginary space?

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:45.738
This cannot be!

01:28:49.992 --> 01:28:50.784
This cannot be...

01:28:51.535 --> 01:28:52.911
This cannot be!

01:28:54.705 --> 01:28:55.539
Humph!

01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:20.105
Caster...

01:29:20.564 --> 01:29:21.607
disappeared?

01:29:26.737 --> 01:29:27.488
Tohsaka!

01:29:35.829 --> 01:29:36.747
Emiya!

01:29:38.332 --> 01:29:39.249
Shirou!

01:29:43.128 --> 01:29:45.172
It wasn't like he touched the actual body.

01:29:45.422 --> 01:29:47.341
Maybe just contracted ague.

01:29:48.342 --> 01:29:52.971
Archer, do you know
exactly what that thing earlier was?

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:54.723
No idea.

01:29:55.224 --> 01:30:00.521
But that shadow must be the one
soaking up magical energy from the citizens.

01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:03.732
Shirou...

01:30:07.736 --> 01:30:09.822
Emiya, are you all right?

01:30:10.489 --> 01:30:12.407
Y-Yeah.

01:30:13.534 --> 01:30:18.872
It seems that this is not the situation
where I can prioritize my personal business.

01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:37.432
Sakura, I'm sorry.

01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:39.351
I was with him, too.

01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:40.853
Please hand him over!

01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:44.356
It'll just be uncomfortable for Senpai.

01:31:09.047 --> 01:31:10.215
So you're here.

01:31:15.721 --> 01:31:17.806
Sorry to call for you.

01:31:18.348 --> 01:31:21.935
I got here early,
so I decided to go ahead and eat.

01:31:22.394 --> 01:31:23.187
It's fine.

01:31:34.907 --> 01:31:36.241
- Want to eat?
- Like I'd eat!

01:31:38.785 --> 01:31:41.413
What did you want to talk about?

01:31:52.132 --> 01:31:53.759
Shirou Emiya...

01:31:54.343 --> 01:31:55.928
What did you see last night?

01:32:01.183 --> 01:32:02.059
Well,

01:32:02.517 --> 01:32:06.563
I've been observing this Holy Grail War
in my own way.

01:32:07.022 --> 01:32:11.151
I'd gotten reports from Rin
about the case at Ryudou Temple.

01:32:13.445 --> 01:32:15.656
We engaged Zouken Matou in battle.

01:32:16.448 --> 01:32:18.367
He'd brought Caster with him,

01:32:19.159 --> 01:32:20.160
but well,

01:32:20.911 --> 01:32:23.205
it was as if he was controlling a corpse.

01:32:23.956 --> 01:32:26.750
So that elder has been on the move.

01:32:31.296 --> 01:32:33.006
Shirou Emiya...

01:32:33.632 --> 01:32:36.051
Rin doesn't even know this,

01:32:36.343 --> 01:32:39.054
but the night Caster was killed
in Ryudou Temple,

01:32:39.304 --> 01:32:42.891
one Servant got away from the temple.

01:32:44.351 --> 01:32:45.560
Do you understand?

01:32:46.311 --> 01:32:47.521
No.

01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:49.439
It's Assassin.

01:32:51.650 --> 01:32:53.193
How do you know that?

01:33:00.867 --> 01:33:03.453
Because my Lancer witnessed it.

01:33:06.707 --> 01:33:10.669
I just said, I was also a Master.

01:33:11.712 --> 01:33:12.587
Well...

01:33:13.088 --> 01:33:15.674
Dammit, I'm so confused!

01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:20.929
I'd ordered Lancer to monitor Assassin.

01:33:21.555 --> 01:33:24.725
He hunted him to Ryudou Temple,
but he never returned.

01:33:25.559 --> 01:33:27.311
Was he defeated by Assassin?

01:33:29.813 --> 01:33:34.192
The Assassin greatly relies
on their Presence Concealment skill,

01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:37.404
but they don't have that high a combat skill.

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:42.993
It would be impossible for Lancer
to lose in a normal battle.

01:33:47.956 --> 01:33:49.082
Shirou Emiya...

01:33:49.666 --> 01:33:51.335
What you saw last night...

01:33:51.626 --> 01:33:55.297
Zouken Matou and Caster weren't
the only ones you saw last night, correct?

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:13.523
It is likely that Assassin knew of it,
and lured Lancer in.

01:34:14.316 --> 01:34:17.736
What lurks there is reaching out
to the citizens of the city,

01:34:17.986 --> 01:34:20.739
and not just Servants.

01:34:21.615 --> 01:34:24.701
If you compare how Caster takes
magical energy from the citizens

01:34:24.951 --> 01:34:27.204
to drawing blood,

01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:29.748
what that thing is doing

01:34:31.416 --> 01:34:33.210
is the very act of eating.

01:34:41.259 --> 01:34:43.387
If we leave it alone as is,

01:34:43.637 --> 01:34:45.722
this city will become uninhabited.

01:34:53.522 --> 01:34:55.107
The number of comatose...

01:34:55.565 --> 01:34:57.192
as many as thirty?

01:34:58.443 --> 01:35:01.530
The location is Miyama South, Block 4.

01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:04.282
What is there?

01:35:06.201 --> 01:35:07.619
Ryudou Temple.

01:35:15.085 --> 01:35:17.587
What's wrong? You're not going to eat?

01:35:21.258 --> 01:35:25.011
I'd rather die
if I have to eat a meal with you.

01:35:35.689 --> 01:35:36.773
Sakura?

01:35:56.585 --> 01:35:57.794
It's starting to fall.

01:36:02.132 --> 01:36:05.469
Hey, Sakura is over at your place, right?

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.472
Huh? Y-Yeah.

01:36:09.556 --> 01:36:11.600
I see. That's reassuring.

01:36:12.476 --> 01:36:17.147
Then, I won't happen to come across she
who doesn't know anything.

01:36:19.774 --> 01:36:21.902
I'm going after Zouken.

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.820
I'm going to the Matou estate.

01:36:24.863 --> 01:36:26.072
That's...

01:36:26.823 --> 01:36:28.992
The Tohsakas and the Matous
have a long history.

01:36:29.242 --> 01:36:33.163
Leave the battle
between archaic Mages to me.

01:36:38.376 --> 01:36:40.378
Hey, Emiya...

01:36:41.630 --> 01:36:44.174
What are you going to do?

01:36:45.467 --> 01:36:46.676
Saber...

01:36:47.469 --> 01:36:52.057
I don't know what you and Senpai are doing.

01:36:52.766 --> 01:36:55.894
I'm sure there are things
you can't answer even if I asked.

01:36:57.354 --> 01:37:01.733
But he came home injured last night.

01:37:05.153 --> 01:37:06.363
I don't want...

01:37:06.696 --> 01:37:09.449
him to be facing danger!

01:37:11.701 --> 01:37:12.702
I...

01:37:13.245 --> 01:37:15.413
I think I'll go after that shadow.

01:37:15.997 --> 01:37:17.791
I can't leave that thing alone.

01:37:18.375 --> 01:37:20.585
People of this city are becoming victims!

01:37:21.294 --> 01:37:22.170
I see.

01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:25.298
Then, we'll keep the cease-fire
between us going.

01:37:26.299 --> 01:37:27.551
Tohsaka...

01:37:28.134 --> 01:37:30.387
I can't overlook that shadow, either.

01:37:31.137 --> 01:37:33.598
But don't go out of your way.

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:38.603
Not until we know what that thing is.

01:37:39.813 --> 01:37:40.730
Yeah.

01:38:04.671 --> 01:38:06.923
Sakura has given me a bitter pill to swallow

01:38:07.173 --> 01:38:08.466
about last night.

01:38:09.718 --> 01:38:13.680
I failed to protect you
because of my inexperience, Shirou.

01:38:16.391 --> 01:38:18.727
I just went and did this to myself.

01:38:21.104 --> 01:38:27.402
The issue is me not being able to stop you
from heading into the battlefield.

01:38:28.445 --> 01:38:32.616
But I will fight together with you
and protect you.

01:38:33.158 --> 01:38:34.951
That is my mission.

01:38:38.455 --> 01:38:40.665
For Sakura's sake, as well.

01:39:07.192 --> 01:39:08.068
What's this?

01:39:08.318 --> 01:39:09.986
- Shirou!
- Sa-

01:39:15.742 --> 01:39:17.369
Shirou! It's Assassin!

01:39:17.577 --> 01:39:18.703
You stay here!

01:39:20.413 --> 01:39:21.206
Saber!

01:39:28.463 --> 01:39:30.465
What flies into a flame?

01:39:30.715 --> 01:39:32.842
You do, indeed.

01:39:33.468 --> 01:39:34.427
Zouken...

01:39:35.261 --> 01:39:36.221
Matou!

01:39:54.906 --> 01:39:55.782
That wind...

01:39:56.157 --> 01:39:58.118
If I take a straight blow,
it would be dangerous.

01:39:59.327 --> 01:40:00.370
O wind!

01:40:02.622 --> 01:40:03.540
Enrage!

01:40:18.513 --> 01:40:20.140
"Protection Against the Wind"...

01:40:20.724 --> 01:40:23.226
A necessity for those who cross the desert.

01:40:27.439 --> 01:40:29.524
It is fine if you are not attacking.

01:40:30.024 --> 01:40:33.903
But your Master is being entertained
by my lord.

01:40:35.029 --> 01:40:36.322
Damn you!

01:40:36.698 --> 01:40:40.994
All I had to do
was merely divert your attention.

01:41:02.223 --> 01:41:03.266
Assassin...

01:41:03.558 --> 01:41:04.559
Damn you!

01:41:05.393 --> 01:41:08.772
Servants cannot oppose that shadow.

01:41:09.564 --> 01:41:11.107
As you are pure,

01:41:11.357 --> 01:41:13.651
merely touching it will make you
lose your sanity.

01:41:15.236 --> 01:41:16.696
But before that...

01:41:18.448 --> 01:41:21.367
I will take your heart.

01:41:26.122 --> 01:41:26.998
Trace...

01:41:27.373 --> 01:41:28.041
on!

01:41:34.714 --> 01:41:38.802
What can you do with a stick like that?

01:41:50.563 --> 01:41:52.023
Zabaniya!

01:42:14.963 --> 01:42:16.840
Saber!

01:42:39.737 --> 01:42:42.740
Nothing less from the supreme Servant.

01:42:43.324 --> 01:42:45.618
She has chosen to confront
her own darkness

01:42:45.869 --> 01:42:48.746
instead of having her heart taken.

01:43:09.267 --> 01:43:11.811
It seems everything is done now.

01:43:13.021 --> 01:43:14.898
If you are a Master, surely you can tell?

01:43:15.356 --> 01:43:20.653
That your Servant has been annihilated
from this world...

01:43:21.487 --> 01:43:22.405
Bastard!

01:44:00.193 --> 01:44:02.779
I will leave you with the rest, Assassin.

01:46:03.149 --> 01:46:04.442
You are fine, I see.

01:46:09.906 --> 01:46:11.407
That is splendid.

01:46:47.318 --> 01:46:48.319
Saber!

01:46:50.696 --> 01:46:52.198
Saber!

01:47:28.818 --> 01:47:29.986
You...

01:47:30.903 --> 01:47:33.322
What the hell are you?

01:47:54.385 --> 01:47:55.511
I see.

01:47:56.429 --> 01:47:58.139
This means that I...

01:47:58.931 --> 01:48:00.433
undeniably,

01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:03.561
am no longer a Master.

01:48:24.081 --> 01:48:26.125
What the hell is this?

01:48:27.835 --> 01:48:29.837
They called this "a training room"?

01:48:34.258 --> 01:48:35.426
No way...

01:48:36.469 --> 01:48:37.803
Not a place like this!

01:49:22.848 --> 01:49:24.684
Do you despise me?

01:49:25.268 --> 01:49:29.563
How I tether my rotting body
with the lives of others...

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.192
No.

01:49:34.277 --> 01:49:36.946
How you're obsessed with life...

01:49:37.905 --> 01:49:40.157
is what makes you worthy to be my lord.

01:49:47.331 --> 01:49:48.874
I see a black kite.

01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:51.752
A black kite, you said?

01:49:55.464 --> 01:49:58.426
Sella, have a car ready to go.

01:49:59.468 --> 01:50:02.430
I will head out into the city
starting tomorrow.

01:50:05.224 --> 01:50:07.351
I don't know who you are,

01:50:07.977 --> 01:50:11.105
but that belongs to the Einzberns.

01:50:24.577 --> 01:50:25.619
Have I...

01:50:26.829 --> 01:50:28.080
Have I lost?

01:50:36.339 --> 01:50:37.256
That's...

01:50:41.594 --> 01:50:42.553
It cannot be!

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:48.851
Don't bother.

01:50:49.393 --> 01:50:50.895
That is the Holy Grail!

01:50:51.812 --> 01:50:55.524
In order to seize it with
my hands, I...

01:50:56.567 --> 01:50:57.568
I'm telling you.

01:50:58.069 --> 01:50:59.862
Don't bother with it.

01:51:04.450 --> 01:51:05.326
Who is it?

01:51:05.576 --> 01:51:06.702
Don't get in my way-

01:51:14.418 --> 01:51:16.796
Who is it, you ask?

01:51:19.715 --> 01:51:20.925
That's something...

01:51:22.968 --> 01:51:24.845
that should be obvious with one look.

01:52:13.769 --> 01:52:16.439
Senpai...

01:52:22.278 --> 01:52:23.946
Where have you been?

01:52:25.364 --> 01:52:27.575
You're injured again like that!

01:52:30.411 --> 01:52:33.747
Please take care of yourself more!

01:52:40.421 --> 01:52:41.297
I'm sorry.

01:52:43.007 --> 01:52:43.966
I'm sorry.

01:52:46.719 --> 01:52:48.053
And...

01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:51.807
I'm home, Sakura.

01:52:57.104 --> 01:52:58.105
Yes.

01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:00.983
Welcome home...

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:02.610
Senpai,

01:53:19.668 --> 01:53:22.087
Hey, Kiritsugu...

01:53:22.963 --> 01:53:24.340
I don't get it.

01:53:25.382 --> 01:53:31.263
