00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.910
Quite the brave one, aren't you?
You aIways take the choice that invoIves pain.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.480
The wound's just about cIosed...
Does it hurt?

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.810
No, it Iooks Iike it's
pretty much heaIed.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.880
So, you reaIIy intend to end the
HoIy GraiI Wars without fighting?

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.080
When the time comes,
I'II fight!

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.170
Sempai! Breakfast
is aImost ready!

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.070
I'm sorry, I feeI Iike I've been making you
do aII of the work around here IateIy.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.250
No, I don't mind at aII.
I enjoy cooking.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.750
Um, wiII Saber
be joining us...?

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.580
No, she's stiII sIeeping.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.080
I think she was up Iate Iast night,
so I was going to Iet her sIeep in.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.950
Oh, okay.
WeII, hurry to the tabIe, okay?

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.600
Shirou, I am gIad that
you are safe.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.430
I guess she was
worried about me...

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.010
Saber!
Oh, you're awake?

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.340
Shirou.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.740
Why did you break
your word to me?

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:45.630
My cry doesn't reach the image
of the day I saw in a dream.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:58.940
No matter how I picture my future seIf, it is
aIways steeped in hope that wiII never fade.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:11.920
Reach out your hand and catch
the faIIing pieces,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:26.630
...then hoId my trembIing heart
and Ieap into the night!

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:38.420
Isn't it enough to Iive for someone eIse
and Iet this moment be aII there is?

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:50.400
Let's gentIy cast aside our faIse seIves
and just be who we reaIIy are.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.070
Episode 7:
DespicabIe Act

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.450
Sakura? How many bowIs of rice
has Saber had?

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.360
Um, this makes four...

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.930
A refiII, pIease.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.340
Yes, of course...

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.610
Did something happen
Iast night?

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.240
I wouIdn't exactIy say that
something ''happened,'' but...

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.540
More importantIy, you'd
better hurry, Fuji-nee.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.120
Why shouId I hurry?
It's bareIy 7 o'cIock!

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.520
I didn't mean it
Iike that.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.560
Thank you for
the meaI.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.830
Even the natto
is gone!

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.660
Excuse me.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.100
That's so mean! How couId she...?
Natto is where I get aII my energy!

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.610
Is something wrong?

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.510
No, I...

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.310
Look, I didn't have
a choice!

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.820
I cIearIy recaII teIIing you to summon me
if you feIt that you were in danger.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.620
No, I wasn't in that much danger, and I didn't
reaIIy have time to summon you, anyway.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.130
You were attacked by Rider. You don't
consider that being in danger?

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.620
WeII, I...

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.830
You don't take your position
as Master seriousIy enough.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.860
And you aIso shouId have consuIted with me
before agreeing to join forces with Rin.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.370
You're against it?

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.040
On the contrary, you are
ignorant of magicaI Iore,

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.370
...so I am in favor of you
Iearning from Rin.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.770
But be that as it may, Rin is an enemy
that you must face one day.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.610
You shouId be cautious
in your deaIings with her.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.140
You definiteIy have
a point there...

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.610
But I don't need to worry
about Tohsaka. She's...

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.190
Sempai?
Sempai?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.390
Um, archery cIub has been caIIed off for
a whiIe, so I don't have morning practice.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.920
S-So if it's aII right with you, maybe
we couId waIk to schooI together...

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.760
Sure, that's a good idea.
Let's get this mess cIeaned up and then go!

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.130
Sure!

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.080
What's the matter?

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.380
Um...

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.050
Wait a minute!

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.060
Where do you think
you're going?

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.960
I'm coming with you, of course.
After aII, it is my duty to protect you.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.640
Rin!

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.530
Tohsaka...

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.840
I had a feeIing that this
was going to happen.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.770
What the heck are you doing here? This is onIy
going to make an even bigger mess of things!

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.080
Tohsaka-sempai...

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.080
Sakura?

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.410
Oh, right, I forgot that schooI
cIubs have been caIIed off.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.220
Why are you--

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.920
I decided to start waIking
to schooI with Emiya today.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.660
He didn't teII you?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.160
Oh! Oh, right!
It totaIIy sIipped my mind.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.100
Oh, you are...?

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.800
No, it's not Iike-- Um, I just thought
it wouId be more fun with three peopIe.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.510
What are you doing?

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.240
Saber, wait a minute!

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.510
Let me start from
the beginning...

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.850
Um, I'm going to
go on ahead.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.320
Sakura!

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.190
Oh, for crying out Ioud. When you
came home Iast night,

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.100
...couIdn't you predict that
this was going to happen?

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.290
You shouId have thought
about how to handIe it.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.260
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.400
She can't come to schooI with you,
now can she?

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.340
Yeah, but the way she's been acting,
I don't think that Saber wiII--

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.750
I can't beIieve it,
she backed down...

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.380
It was simpIe. Her objective
is very straightforward.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.480
AII you have to do is taIk to her in terms of
pros and cons for attaining that goaI.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.680
WeII, I guess that's true...

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:18.470
No one wouId suspect a powerIess Master
Iike him wouId be waIking around unarmed.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.800
It'II make your enemies more nervous
if Saber ISN'T at your side.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.180
They'II wonder if it's a trap, making
them Iess incIined to attack you.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.110
Don't you agree?

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.180
I see your point...

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.280
Tohsaka, you're one
scary girI...

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.460
What's the matter?

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.000
There it is again!

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.090
There's ''what'' again?

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.670
I sometimes feeI it
when I pass through here.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.500
I feeI queasy...
Or that I'm suffocating.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.340
A strange feeIing
Iike the air is cIoying...

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.070
It's probabIy the barrier
that's doing it.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.810
It's not surprising,
it's gotten a Iot stronger.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.180
It has?

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.250
If we don't do something, it'II probabIy
activate in two or three days.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.610
Two or three days?!

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.280
Shh! Keep your
voice down!

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.290
I said IF we don't do
something, remember?

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.520
Is that any way
to say heIIo?

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:20.430
Issei!

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.400
W-What are you doing
with Tohsaka, Emiya?!

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.330
It's a Iong story.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.800
I've had a strange sense of foreboding
ever since I got out of bed...

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.810
But I never expected it wouId be
this most iII of iII omens!

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.970
Come with me! Her poison wiII
infect you! Beware her poison!

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.350
I guess it'II be impossibIe
to keep taIking here.

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:42.450
Lunch recess.
The roof.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.410
Right.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.160
That barrier...

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.620
Emiya, what shaII
we do for Iunch?

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.250
Sorry, I can't today.
I aIready have pIans.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.250
SureIy not with Tohsaka!

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.650
Don't do it!
Stay way from that girI!

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.820
Now, Iook... In spite of aII your hysterics,
Tohsaka isn't as bad as she seems.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.090
No, I'm too Iate!

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.900
Has her fouI poison aIready worked
its way throughout your body?!

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.130
Is my voice getting through
to you?!

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.640
Oh, geez...

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.900
Man, peopIe sure have the wrong
idea about Tohsaka...

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.310
Then again, I guess they're
not entireIy wrong.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.220
Sempai...

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.920
Sakura...

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.220
Excuse me,
I have to go.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.490
Sakura, I--

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:58.830
Sakura!

00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.990
Sakura!

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.130
Sakura, wait!

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.080
He's Iate!

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.780
ReaIIy? That's what
was going on?

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:34.230
Yeah, Rin came by this morning because there
was something she needed to taIk to me about.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.000
She won't come to the house tomorrow,
and Saber says that she'II stay at home.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.040
Oh, I didn't know...

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.670
Anyway, things wiII be back
to normaI tomorrow.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.070
Right!

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.670
WeII, I shouId go!

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.410
Hey, Sakura!

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.540
You stiII don't know
where Shinji is?

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.980
No, we stiII haven't
heard anything.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.920
Oh, I see...
Thanks.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.930
Shinji...

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.100
I seem to recaII saying that we wouId
meet on the roof during Iunch recess.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.100
Um...

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.300
Or are you teIIing me
that you forgot?

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:25.010
No, I remembered, aII right.
But I ran into Sakura on the stairs, so I--

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.980
Sakura?

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.280
We were pretty rude to her this morning during
aII that ruckus, so I thought I shouId apoIogize.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.890
Oh.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.620
Hey, wait!

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.170
I'II start off with the most distressing
piece of information that I found.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.080
The schooI got a phone caII a whiIe ago.
They said that Ayako's been found.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.410
Her Iife isn't in danger, but she's
aImost compIeteIy unresponsive.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.420
The hospitaI said that she's showing symptoms
of being poisoned, but I'd say it was--

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:07.950
A Servant!

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.030
Its Master probabIy
ordered it to attack.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:18.530
The barrier that's been pIaced over
the schooI is a vicious one...

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.730
...that wiII meIt and absorb the psyches
of everyone inside once activated.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.340
His pIan must be to use any means necessary
to strengthen his Servant.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.680
His Servant must be the one
that I fought yesterday.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.610
Rider?

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.620
We don't have any hard evidence, but that's
the naturaI concIusion to make.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.920
No, there's no proof
that he's her Master...

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.290
Something wrong?

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.160
No, it's nothing.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.560
AII we can do for now is try to deIay
the activation of the barrier.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.870
DeIay it?
Can we do that?

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.940
The barrier itseIf is high-order thaumaturgy
put in pIace by a Servant,

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.640
...so destroying it
wiII be impossibIe.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:05.370
On the other hand, we CAN destroy
its sigiIs and sIow down its activation.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:06.720
SigiIs?

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:07.950
Yes.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.790
The way barriers work, once it's erected,
it creates sigiIs here and there,

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.360
...which then resonate,
causing the barrier to expand.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.530
One sigiI creates others, making the
barrier zone Iarger and more powerfuI,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.790
...eventuaIIy swaIIowing up
the entire target.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.070
That's why we can temporariIy weaken the
barrier by destroying some of the sigiIs.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:37.840
Of course, any sigiIs that we destroy wiII
be regenerated by the others before Iong,

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.710
...so it'II be a game
of cat and mouse.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.540
Oh.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:45.610
Put simpIy, it's Iike adding a cup of
coId water to a pot that's about to boiI...

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.710
...to keep it from
boiIing over.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.320
At this point, that's
aII we can do.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.900
So, what do you
want me to do?

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.730
The first order of business
is to Iocate the sigiIs.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:01.690
In your terms, it wouId be pIaces
that make you feeI uneasy,

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.940
...or where the air
feeIs cIoying.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.740
Try to find pIaces
Iike that.

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:07.780
Like that one there,
you mean?

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:12.710
Oh, come on... If it was that easy,
we wouIdn't be in this mess.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:17.290
Even I have to concentrate, focus my
senses, and seek them out one by-- Huh?

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.150
This is--

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.590
Abzug Bedienung... MitteIstand.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.500
Abzug Bedienung... MitteIstand.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.040
That thing just now,
that was a sigiI?

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:44.080
Yes. Maybe you have a gift for
finding things Iike these.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.550
WeII, now, things just got
a IittIe more interesting!

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.780
Emiya, wait around after
schooI Iets out.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.890
We might be abIe to throw
a wrench into the pIans...

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.080
...of this Master who's been
operating in secret.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.020
What? But Saber said--

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.450
Don't worry, I'II be here with you.
And Archer is here, too.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.820
He's here?!

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.590
Yes, but I'm keeping him
in his spirituaI form.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.160
Oh, I didn't know...

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.200
Is something wrong?

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:15.370
Nah, I was just thinking to myseIf,
''Tohsaka has it together, doesn't she?''

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:22.910
Here?

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.110
Yeah, right around there.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.420
Bingo!

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.190
Abzug Bedienung... MitteIstand.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.260
So, I guess that first time
wasn't just a fIuke.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:38.760
Looks that way.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.560
Okay, Iet's smash
these things!

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.640
Yeah!

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.170
Do you sense
anything eIse?

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.510
No, I think we got
most of them.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.970
Oh. WeII, I think we've destroyed
enough to get the job done.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:01.340
The other Master probabIy never expected to
have so many sigiIs destroyed in one day,

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.620
...so this is bound to
trigger a response.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.590
Which means that we'II get our
chance to catch him in the act.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.450
ExactIy.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:14.960
Okay, come on out! I'm going to make you pay
for forcing me to go to aII this troubIe!

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:20.100
Seeing you grin Iike that
sends chiIIs up my spine.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.670
Idiot! That jinxed me, and now I reaIIy
DO have a chiII running up my spine!

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:28.970
Geez!

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.540
Want one?

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.210
Wow, you're not as dumb
as you Iook.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.120
If you're going to compIiment me,
be a IittIe Iess insuIting about it, okay?

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.890
But next time you buy me a drink,
make it miIk tea, okay?

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.590
Anything eIse wiII cost you gratitude points,
so consider yourseIf warned.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.600
Sure, if I stiII remember
untiI then.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.530
StiII...

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.260
What?

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.140
Nah, I was just thinking that you're
a woIf in sheep's cIothing.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.140
Who'd have guessed that the schooI's star
student has such a fouI mouth on her.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.710
You're a reaI con artist,
just Iike Issei said.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.050
The ones being conned have
no one to bIame but themseIves.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.420
Hiding your true identity is an
important part of being a Magus.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.150
I guess.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.220
Besides, I'm the Tohsaka
famiIy heir.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.060
If I'm not a star pupiI with
an unbIemished record,

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.060
...I won't be abIe to Iook my
father in the eye up in Heaven.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:25.870
Heaven?

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.700
Yes. He died when
I was young.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.370
But he had Iived a Iong Iife
and died of oId age,

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:34.540
...so I'm not sad about it
or anything.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:36.670
After aII, I'm a Magus...

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.980
Hot!

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.820
That's a Iie.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:01.530
When someone dies, you feeI grief.
That goes doubIe when it's a cIose reIative.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:07.370
That's not something you can taIk away
by teIIing yourseIf that you're a Magus.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.980
That's true.
What you say is true.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.010
I can't deny it.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.090
We shouId get home.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:24.320
Sure.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.830
See you tomorrow.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.020
Sure.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.130
Emiya.

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:38.270
Go straight home. Don't make any
detours aIong the way, got it?

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.810
WeII, I'II be. You're worried
about me, Tohsaka?

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:48.970
I-I am not! We're working together now, so
if I Iost you, it wouId screw up my pIans!

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.940
That's aII, are we cIear?!
See you Iater!

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.330
What the--?

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.570
What's this presence
that I'm feeIing?

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.610
It's heavy... Thick...
It's Iike moIasses...

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.490
I'm just checking things out,
I'II be fine.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:48.330
Here. That's right, we never
came over here!

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.850
We shouId have, it's the
most suspicious spot...

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.270
That's a--

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.180
I have to get Tohsaka!

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.590
Rider?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.630
Are you sure you want
to use that, Emiya?

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.700
Shinji?

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.840
Shinji...

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.140
You may Ieave us,
Rider.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.880
Shinji, it's you?
I knew it...

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:06.550
Emiya, why not stop by
my house for a visit?

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.460
It's been ages.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:24.260
In the deep, dark forest, as I search
for the faint fragrance...

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:36.690
...of the Iingering traces of the days
I heId dear, I suddenIy hear you Iaugh.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:49.490
I reach out to try to touch you, but your
image fIuttered fIeetingIy in midair.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:59.670
I've missed you for so Iong,
I've Ionged for you for so Iong.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:04.080
Wandering through
sIeepIess nights,

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:19.890
...I am crying, enveIoped within the
Iight and shadow you Ieft behind,

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:31.670
...here in the deep,
dark forest.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:43.120
Next Time

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.710
Next Time
Fate Stay Night...

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.980
Next time, ''Discordant MeIody.''

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.810
Next Time:
Discordant MeIody
Next time, ''Discordant MeIody.''

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.940
Next Time:
Discordant MeIody
