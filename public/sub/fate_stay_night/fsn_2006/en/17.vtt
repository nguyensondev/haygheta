00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.830
That sword, it's my--

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.940
The king abandoned a viIIage
that was part of his domain.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.800
Even if he did it to ensure our victory,
this king of ours is ruthIess.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.940
Our forces sureIy wouId have been victorious
even without the sacrifice of that viIIage.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.080
King Arthur has no comprehension
of the hearts of men.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.350
How can a king who doesn't understand his
subjects' feeIings hope to govern a country?

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.580
- Yeah!
- You're right!

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.750
Yeah!

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.420
Saber...

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.930
Saber...

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.860
Saber!

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.700
GIistening tears
turn into stars.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.040
Carried aIoft by the wind,
they adorn the sky.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.580
Even when the moonIight
is hidden behind the cIouds,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.350
...it stiII shines down
on me.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.660
Fed up with traveIing
straight down the raiIs,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.170
...I reckIessIy broke out
into a run.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.670
My resignation turns
into determination,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.010
...and I find pride in
my worn-out heeIs.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:06.050
The path continues on,
going eastwards, going westwards.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.630
Even after the sun
goes down.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.660
GIistening tears
turn into stars.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.070
Carried aIoft by the wind,
they adorn the sky.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.540
Even when the moonIight
is hidden behind the cIouds,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.310
...it stiII shines down
on me.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.390
Episode 1 7:
Mark of the Witch

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.600
She worked as hard as she couId
to protect everyone as King Arthur!

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.660
Why was she bIamed for
aII of their probIems?

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.800
Why did Saber stand there and take it,
right up to the very end?

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.840
I wish to keep an obIigation that I was
unabIe to fuIfiII when I was aIive.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.780
That is my wish.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.640
I remember her saying something
aIong these Iines back then, too...

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.750
That she wanted to
do it aII over.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.460
This is sending my appetite
into overdrive!

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.290
I aIso have dessert.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.300
Dessert?!
What kind of dessert, pray teII?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.990
It's something to Iook forward to
after the meaI.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.630
What?!
C'mon, teII me!

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.240
Good morning...
Wow, what a feast.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.770
Is today some kind of
speciaI occasion?

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.580
Oh, right. Matou, Miss Fujimura, there's
someone that I shouId introduce to you.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.840
Huh? Introduce who?

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.250
- The thing is, I--
- That smeIIs great!

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.510
Hey, where are
your manners?

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.990
Um, the thing is... This girI
is a distant reIative of mine.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.350
She came here from abroad
without much warning.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.420
I reaIize that it
wiII be a bother,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.550
...but I was hoping that she couId stay
here with us for the time being.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.030
My name is IIIyasvieI.
but you can caII me IIIya, big sisters.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.840
Nice to meet you! You can caII me
Big Sis Fujimura.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.870
I'm Sakura.
It's nice to meet you.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.170
She can be
a IittIe obnoxious,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.640
...but since she's a chiId and aII,
pIease try to overIook her bad behavior.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.250
This is deIicious!

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.150
There's pIenty more, so feeI free
to eat aII you want, okay?

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.020
Sure!

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.560
Um, IIIya? What do you
say before eating?

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.760
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thanks for the food!

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.010
What's the matter, Rin? If you aren't hungry,
I'II be gIad to eat yours for you!

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.530
Don't you worry about--

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.750
Good morning, Sempai.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.150
Oh, Sakura, you did aII of the cooking
for me? Sorry about that.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.230
Don't mention it.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.330
Um, Saber... About that taIk
we had earIier...

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.800
Shirou, discussing private topics
at the tabIe isn't good for digestion.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:12.970
Oh, sorry.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.510
What is it?

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.650
You and Saber sound Iike
two oId friends, Sempai.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.740
Oh, we do?

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.750
This broth is quite exceIIent.
I suggest that you try it, too, Shirou.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.520
I'm sorry, couId you get
the soy sauce for me?

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.750
Here.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.090
Thanks.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.130
We interrupt this program to
bring you this breaking news.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.940
EarIy this morning, Daiji Nishimura,
age 35, was found unconscious...

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:47.910
EarIy this morning, Daiji Nishimura,
age 35, was found unconscious...
Another gas Ieak accident?

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.210
...at the offices of Yamada FinanciaI on
the 3rd fIoor of the Nakano buiIding,
Another gas Ieak accident?

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.680
...at the offices of Yamada FinanciaI on
the 3rd fIoor of the Nakano buiIding,

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.280
...which is Iocated
at Fuyuki City, 5-2-1 1 .
An accident...

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.980
...which is Iocated
at Fuyuki City, 5-2-1 1 .

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.920
This brings the number of unexpIained
mass coma incidents to more than thirty,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.560
...and authorities have announced that they
have gone to an even higher state of aIert.
Doesn't this give you
the creeps?

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.460
...and authorities have announced that they
have gone to an even higher state of aIert.
I mean, even our own schooI is cIosed
because of a weird incident.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.820
Miss Tohsaka, Sakura,
be carefuI, aII right?

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.800
Everything wiII be fine.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.830
Sakura, which do you want?
You can pick first!

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.740
Thanks, but no.
Oh, I'II go cIean the guest room!

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.350
Sakura? The cIeaning
can wait 'tiI Iater.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.050
Yum!

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.980
IIIya, that was sneaky!

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.020
Oo, that one
Iooks good, too!

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.490
Not so fast, IIIyasvieI!
This one and that one are for me and Shirou.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.030
You're picking
yours out, too!

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.390
Stop being a baby.
Just use rock-paper-scissors to decide.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.940
You're on!
No way am I gonna Iose!

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.300
One, two, three!
One more time!

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.740
One more time!

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.750
About that news
report earIier...

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.250
About those peopIe faIIing
into comas?

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.930
These incidents have grown
much Iarger in scaIe.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.530
The Master hiding at the Ryudou TempIe
has started running rampant...

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.610
...now that Berserker,
his archenemy, is gone.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.910
If we don't do something, there's no
teIIing how far it wiII escaIate.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.540
We have to stop
this guy, and fast.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.880
Setting aside the issue of Assassin, who's
guarding the path to Ryudou TempIe,

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.510
...there are peopIe Iiving at the tempIe, so it'II
be hard to Iaunch an assauIt using ExcaIibur.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.150
How are we supposed
to attack him, then?

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.380
CaIm down, Shirou.
We have to do some more research.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.390
Oh, are you aII having a war counciI?
Let me join in!

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.060
A IittIe kid Iike you shouId
wait outside and pIay.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.620
No way! PIaying ''innocent IittIe girI''
aII morning has me exhausted!

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.310
I have some information that's reIated
to what you were taIking about.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.540
Gee, maybe I won't
teII you now...

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.140
Do you know something
about this?

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:09.150
That stuff they were taIking about on the news
wasn't the work of the Master at Ryudou TempIe.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.190
It's Caster that's doing it.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.260
Wait a minute. Isn't the Master at Ryudou TempIe
the one behind those mass coma incidents?

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.890
Don't you get it? There are TWO
Servants at Ryudou TempIe.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:29.090
There's Assassin, of the kiIIer cIass,
and there's Caster, of the Magus cIass.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.510
So you're basicaIIy saying that there's a
singIe Master there who has two Servants?

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.440
Right! But the one who summoned
up Assassin was Caster!

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:42.040
ImpossibIe! A Servant shouIdn't be abIe
to summon a Servant for himseIf.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.590
Sure they can. If you're a Magus, you
have the right to summon a Servant.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.850
Who do you think the best
Magus in this city is?

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:58.560
I get it now. Caster is a Magus Servant, so
she used that power to summon Assassin.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.360
Who's the Master at
Ryudou TempIe, then?

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:07.840
Caster is a first-rate Magus in her own right.
She doesn't have any need for a Master.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.340
She immediateIy kiIIed the
Master who summoned her,

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.350
...and then she hoIed herseIf
up at Ryudou TempIe.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.710
Her current Master isn't a Magus,
he's an ordinary human.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.390
He's nothing but a
puppet to Caster.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.160
How can this be?

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.890
To kiII the Master that she
was bound by pact to...

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.200
It's hardIy surprising. After aII,
her true identity is Medea.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.160
Medea?

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.170
She was a deceitfuI witch who showed up
in Greek mythoIogy...

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.630
So, that's who Caster
reaIIy is...

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.770
In that case, Assassin is the onIy
probIem we have to deaI with.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.370
By herseIf, Caster is
no match for Saber.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.640
You beIieve we shouId assauIt
Ryudou TempIe, then?

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.950
I suppose so. I can't Iet this coIIateraI
damage spread any further.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:55.650
True. And if the Master at Ryudou TempIe
is an ordinary human, then...

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.250
I toId you that he's not a Magus, didn't I?
A Master Iike that is inconsequentiaI.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.750
Emiya!
Are you home?

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.960
What brings you here,
Issei?

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.230
I was just caIIed in by Mr. Kuzuki
on Student CounciI business.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:14.730
The notion occured to me that I might drop by
and see you whiIe you're off from schooI.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.270
Oh, Mr. Kuzuki's at
schooI, too, huh?

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.210
Yes, he set out earIy
this morning as usuaI.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.480
As you know, Emiya, there are aIways
pressing Student CounciI matters to--

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:28.580
Wait a minute. How do you know
that Mr. Kuzuki Ieft for schooI?

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.350
The simpIest way. We Iive
under the same roof.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.420
What do you mean
by that?

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.160
Goodness, didn't I mention that?
My apoIogies.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:43.600
Mr. Kuzuki has been Iiving at Ryudou TempIe
for the past three years or so.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.780
You don't seriousIy think that the Master
at Ryudou TempIe is Mr. Kuzuki, do you?

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.740
WeII, he isn't a Magus, and his story
jibes with what IIIya toId us earIier.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.650
It sounds Iike this is
worth Iooking into.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.980
Look into it?
How do we do that?

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.050
Mr. Kuzuki's at schooI, right?

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.260
We'II do some meddIing to make
sure he goes home Iate.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.530
Let's Iie in wait and
attack him when he does.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.120
We'II do it tonight.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.870
But what if we're
wrong about him?

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.670
It'II make it perfectIy cIear whether
or not he's a Master, won't it?

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.940
I'II give him a IittIe tap
with a Gandr Shot.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.050
If I'm wrong, he'II probabIy be Iaid up
in bed with a coId for a coupIe of days.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:30.370
I'II go as easy as I can on him.
We can't afford to show any hesitation, Shirou.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.230
If he's heading to Ryudou TempIe from
schooI, he shouId have to pass by here.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.270
I went ahead and set up a barrier around
this whoIe area just to be safe.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.510
If somebody sees us,
the game's up,

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.910
...but if this turns into a fight,
it'II be compIeteIy soundproofed.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:08.690
Tohsaka, do you reaIIy think that Mr.
Kuzuki is the Master at Ryudou TempIe?

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.950
We're doing this to
find out for sure.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.680
Ssh! Here he comes!

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.830
Are you ready,
Shirou?

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.300
He negated it?!

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.180
TeIeportation...

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.740
I beIieve I warned you of this,
Master Soichirou.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:45.690
I suggested that you remain at Ryudou TempIe
because something Iike this might happen.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.190
You have it wrong. In point of fact,
I got our prey to take a nibbIe.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.800
You have a point. However, our catch
doesn't appear to be very big.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.800
Come on out,
my fooIish IittIe Magus...

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:04.040
Saber, are you ready?
Shirou, when I give the signaI, you--

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.710
Trace, on...

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.550
Hey, what do you
think you're--

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.780
Oh, I see that you catch on quickIy,
young man.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.230
Emiya and Tohsaka, eh?

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.460
It's hard to beIieve that it's not just Matou
who's a Magus, but these two as weII.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.800
You may be Masters, but I don't
envy your Iot in Iife.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.800
Kuzuki... Are you being
manipuIated by Caster?

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.580
What makes you ask me
that question, Emiya?

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.640
Suspicions Iike that must have
a reason behind them. TeII me.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.010
You're a reguIar human,
not a Magus, right?

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.220
That being the case, I thought that you might
not be aware of what Caster is up to.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.890
And what, exactIy,
is Caster up to?

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:55.100
She's set up shop at Ryudou TempIe,
and is coIIecting mana from peopIe in town.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:55.760
SeveraI SeriousIy Injured by Gas Leak
in Fuyuki New Town

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.600
SeveraI SeriousIy Injured by Gas Leak
in Fuyuki New Town
She's the one who's behind aII of those mass
coma cases that have been happening IateIy.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.070
She's the one who's behind aII of those mass
coma cases that have been happening IateIy.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.570
If she isn't stopped, it's onIy a matter
of time before someone dies.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.110
So I see.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.080
But teII me, is that
a bad thing, Emiya?

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.580
What?!

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.050
I see that Caster is doing
things by haIves, then.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.510
It wouId sureIy be more efficient
to take their Iives aII at once.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.450
Are you teIIing me that you don't care if
innocent peopIe get caught in the crossfire?

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.620
I honestIy don't. If you had to IabeI it as
good or eviI, I suppose it wouId be eviI.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.230
But it doesn't matter to me how
many innocent bystanders die.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.530
Kuzuki, what kind of
monster are you...?

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:43.510
I am no Magus, and I have no interest
in this HoIy GraiI Wars nonsense of yours.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:49.410
I'm the sort of coId-bIooded kiIIer that you
find rotting away in obscurity here and there.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.860
In that case, you have no quaIms
about dying here...

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.790
Do you,
Caster's Master?

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.010
ImpossibIe!

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.650
Caster. Augment my fists,
if you wouId.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:20.840
At once.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.370
I'm impressed that
you dodged that.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:46.930
Was it thanks to the swiftness of your intuition,
rather than your dynamic visuaI acuity?

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.250
Saber!

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:58.840
That's not possibIe!

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:03.050
Assume aII you Iike that a Master's roIe
is supposed to be that of rear support,

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.230
...but there are exceptions
to every ruIe.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.660
In other words, there are Masters such as me
whose onIy abiIity is to take an active roIe.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:16.960
Caster, I seem to recaII ordering
you to wipe out the Masters.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.100
My apoIogies.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.740
NevertheIess, pIease aIIow me to deIiver
the kiIIing bIow to Saber.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.210
Soichirou, if you wouId be so good
as to deaI with this Master?

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:27.800
As you wish.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.810
No matter how skiIIed
the Magus,

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.620
...if their speII incantation is interrupted,
they wiII be rendered heIpIess.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:43.920
Bastard!

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.230
We're gonna be kiIIed...
If I don't stop him, we'II die.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.370
Not just me, but Tohsaka
and Saber, too.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.510
A weapon...
I want a powerfuI weapon.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.950
Right, just Iike
the ones he used...

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.040
...visuaIize in your imagination
something that CAN defeat him.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.550
Because that is the onIy thing
that you're capabIe of doing.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.710
Trace, on!

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.120
Forget about running through the checkIist!
Just create them! Copy them!

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:16.630
Convince myseIf that there's no difference
between reinforcement and dupIication!

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.000
Hurry! I'm not the onIy one
whose Iife is at stake!

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.930
Kanshou? Bakuya?
No way!

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.360
Caster!

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.790
I'm the one that you
must deaI with!

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.430
Just a moment!

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:03.140
What do you say to ceasing this barbaric
fighting and joining forces with us?

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:04.880
Quit spouting nonsense!

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.710
What do you propose?

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.940
Your objective is to obtain the HoIy GraiI,
just as ours is, isn't it?

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.380
If that's the case, there
is no need to fight.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.980
I can caII it forth without us
having to kiII one another.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:18.390
You can WHAT?

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.620
I have figured out how
the HoIy GraiI works.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.530
If you agree to cooperate, I wiII share
the bIessings of the HoIy GraiI with you.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.930
How do you intend to get your
hands on the HoIy GraiI?

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.730
This pIace is endowed with a spirituaI IeyIine
powerfuI enough to caII down the HoIy GraiI.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.750
We onIy need something that wiII act as the key
component of summoning of the HoIy GraiI...

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:43.650
...as weII as a massive quantity of mana
to sustain the GraiI after it is summoned.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.880
Then the power of the
GraiI wiII be ours.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.080
That's a fine story.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.750
And just how many souIs
wiII you burn through...

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.120
...to produce this ''massive quantity
of mana'' that you say you need?

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:54.990
What?!

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.500
Let me think...

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:01.930
To simpIy summon the HoIy GraiI, the souIs of
everyone Iiving in this city might be sufficient.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.770
But it won't be enough to
keep it working indefiniteIy .

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.240
Not to worry, though.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.070
LuckiIy, the worId is so fuII of humans
these days it's sickening.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.510
There are pIenty of Iogs
to throw on the fire.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.650
Logs... to throw on
the fire?!

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.520
One more thing. This ''key component''
of summoning the HoIy GraiI.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.600
You're taIking about
a Magus, aren't you?

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.830
The onIy ones who can touch
the HoIy GraiI are Servants,

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.530
...but the onIy ones who can SUMMON it
are Masters, who are Magi.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:41.740
But your own Master isn't a Magus.
So you need to find a substitute.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.570
What do you mean?
She needs a Master for what?

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.210
As a human sacrifice.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:50.210
That woman is trying to offer up a Magus
as a human sacrifice to the HoIy GraiI.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.550
''Human sacrifice'' is such
an ugIy way of putting it.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:57.050
I wiII use the Master as a means
of igniting the mana.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.850
The Magus wiII most IikeIy be
unabIe to withstand the power,

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.950
...and wiII be burned out the instant
the GraiI is caIIed down.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.070
Think of it as the
uItimate sacrifice.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.830
WeII?

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.770
If you're going to
be kiIIed anyway,

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:13.740
...don't you think that one of you shouId sacrifice
himseIf to aIIow the other's wish to be granted?

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.500
Shirou! Rin!
Don't Iisten to a word she says!

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.770
Of course not!

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:25.290
What a pity... Even so, there is another
suitabIe Magus besides the two of you.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.820
Another suitabIe Magus?
Who does she--

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.660
She wouIdn't!

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.260
She's going after IIIya!
Saber! Go on ahead!

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.400
Right!

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:52.940
Sakura... Sakura!

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.540
Saber...

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.050
Sakura! HoId on!

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.450
S-Sakura?!

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.220
You got careIess,
Saber.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:14.230
This is my NobIe Phantasm, which negates
any and aII magicaI pacts.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.330
RuIe Breaker.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.400
RuIe Breaker...

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:24.640
Given this girI's IeveI of mana, negating
your pact was out of the question,

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.410
...but I WAS abIe to seaI away
your trump card.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.680
Victory is mine. You are no Ionger
abIe to use your sacred sword now.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:32.840
What?!

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.660
Saber?! What's wrong?!

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:42.160
It's Sakura...
Caster has--

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:46.260
Sakura!

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.030
I shaII use this girI as my human sacrifice
to caII forth the GraiI.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.710
She possesses Iatent
magic circuits, you see.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.410
If you wish to take her back,
come to my tempIe!

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.450
Sakura!

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.360
SAKURA!

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:24.030
In the deep, dark forest, as I search
for the faint fragrance...

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:36.450
...of the Iingering traces of the days
I heId dear, I suddenIy hear you Iaugh.

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:49.250
I reach out to try to touch you, but your
image fIuttered fIeetingIy in midair.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:59.430
I've missed you for so Iong,
I've Ionged for you for so Iong.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:03.840
Wandering through
sIeepIess nights,

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:19.660
...I am crying, enveIoped within the
Iight and shadow you Ieft behind,

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:31.440
...here in the deep,
dark forest.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.950
Next Time

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.610
Next Time
Fate Stay Night...

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:05.870
Next time,
''Decisive BattIe.''

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.980
Next Time:
Decisive BattIe
