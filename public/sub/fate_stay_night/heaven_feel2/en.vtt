00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:44.711
Saber!

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:48.757
Saber!

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:57.599
Saber!

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:02.271
Saber!

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:26.169
Saber...

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:31.800
You're safe.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:33.760
I made it in.

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:47.774
Saber!

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:02.748
How...

00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:04.958
am I here again?

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.270
Who are you?

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:29.816
What in the hell...

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:33.737
are you?

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:08.646
On-site investigations
are continuing,

00:03:08.647 --> 00:03:09.730
but as the police entered the destruction site this morning...
PART OF MT. ENZO COLLAPSED

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.816
but as the police entered the
destruction site this morning...

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:12.192
Um, Senpai...

00:03:12.193 --> 00:03:14.902
they found some of the temple
buildings have collapsed.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:15.237
Senpai?

00:03:15.238 --> 00:03:16.654
We'll take you to the scene.

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:18.572
Y-Yeah, What is it?

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.784
I'm here in front
of Ryudou Temple,

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.369
located at Mt.
Enzo in the Miyama area...

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.995
Saber left for her home all
of a sudden, didn't she?

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:27.123
The site is cordoned...

00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:29.084
and we are unable to see inside.

00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:35.297
The collapse occurred in the building
and the area around the pond.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:36.298
But now,

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:42.514
you no longer have to
so out at night, right?

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.186
So, you're not going to be
in danger anymore, right?

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.900
No.

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.446
You're wrong about that, Sakura.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.782
I wasn't tagging
along with Saber.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.910
Saber was the one who was
tagging along with me.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:08.498
I might be going
out more often now.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:15.922
But I don't want you to
wait for me at the entrance.

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:22.637
That's right.

00:04:22.763 --> 00:04:24.431
It's not over yet.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.019
The one I must fight...

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.400
is still in this city.

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.628
LANE CLOSED AT FUYUKI
ON-RAMP DUE TO ACCIDENT

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.921
ALL LANES NOW CLEAR

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:02.821
New City.

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.031
Central Park.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.410
Ryudou Temple.

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:13.081
What is the shadow-like
thing after?

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.751
And what is its
relationship with Zouken?

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:19.379
Is it working for him?

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:23.174
Or is he just taking
advantage of it?

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.304
I may have to ask
Tohsaka about this.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.730
What the...

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:45.989
You're still alive, Big Brother!

00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:56.333
Tell me your name.

00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:59.836
Your name, Big Brother.

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:01.963
S-Sure.

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:05.467
I'm Shirou. Shirou Emiya.

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:06.718
Shirou!

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.678
Shirou! Shirou! Right?

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.931
Yep!

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.522
H-Hold on!

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.024
Hold on a second!

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.734
We're enemies,
aren't we, Illyasviel?

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:25.320
Just call me Illya!

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:29.324
Masters can only fight
each other at night.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.202
I came here to chat with
you, Shirou.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:36.081
Look,
you suddenly hacked away at me,

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.750
and now you wanna chat with me?

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:42.045
What? That was just an accident!

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:47.175
It was all because you jumped in
recklessly even though you're weak!

00:07:47.676 --> 00:07:51.179
I could kill you right
here, right now, too.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.558
Without Saber,
you'd be killed in an instant!

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:02.357
Besides,

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:05.777
I've been waiting for
this chance all this time.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:08.238
So, don't I deserve
a little chat?

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:16.162
So, you're living in the
castle in the forest.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:17.538
All alone?

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:19.582
No, with Sella and Liz.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:24.546
I sneaked out behind Sella's
back just to see you!

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.673
You should feel honored!

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:28.425
Oh, I guess.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:34.055
Then,
can I ask you one more thing?

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:38.685
Does the name Kiritsugu
Emiya ring any bells?

00:08:46.067 --> 00:08:47.068
Illya?

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:50.655
Don't know.

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:54.534
I don't know a name like that.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.495
I'm going home.

00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:01.123
Illya!

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.255
Huh?

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.215
Emiya?

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:15.764
Tohsaka!

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:23.813
Good timing!

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:26.900
I wanted to have a chat with
you, too.

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:31.154
We could chat at
school, too, you know.

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:34.365
Archer,
can you make us some tea?

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:38.119
You don't want to?

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:40.121
What's with that face?

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.832
Jeez, fine!

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:55.303
Huh?

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:57.847
This is...

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.519
What are you doing?

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.523
Now,
let's discuss our game plan.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:05.748
I have to get ready for dinner.

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:17.719
Why didn't you tell me earlier
that Sakura had a fever?

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.722
'Cause you didn't
let me interrupt you!

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:23.807
It's open.

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:27.353
Sakura, are you awake?

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:42.159
Emiya?

00:11:43.077 --> 00:11:44.120
Jeez!

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:02.096
Shinji! Let go of Sakura!

00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:08.518
Shinji!

00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:12.232
Don't worry, Sakura.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.360
I won't kill Emiya or anything.

00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:19.989
I just want him to feel a
little pain, that's all.

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:22.951
Fight with Rider.

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:27.372
If you survive,
I don't mind letting go of her.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.792
Get him, Rider!

00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:36.339
If you were going to fight,

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:40.260
you shouldn't have come alone.

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:22.260
What's wrong, Emma'?

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:25.972
It'd be so boring if
you croaked too easily!

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:35.940
You won since you
have good endurance.

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.324
Good!
Now, don't hold back anymore.

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:49.704
Just kill him off right
now, Rider!

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:50.955
Stop it, Big Brother.

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:15.480
Sakura...

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:19.067
Senpai!

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:33.038
Wh...

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.583
Why?

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:48.846
Magecraft...

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:18.334
Rider!

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:21.087
Kill him!

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:56.080
T-Tohsaka?

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:58.332
Why?

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:02.211
Emiya and I have
formed a coalition.

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:06.466
It just so happens that we
were together all day today.

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:10.011
Because you used Sakura as bait,

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:14.682
you completely made
yourself my enemy.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:17.977
Sakura...

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:22.773
Sakura, Sakura, Sakura,
Sakura, Sakura, Sakura!

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:25.860
Why do you care about
someone like her?

00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:28.446
I was the one who
became a Master!

00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:35.453
Stand up, Rider!

00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:38.623
Damn you!

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:41.751
Don't...

00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:47.965
Rider, please don't...

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:49.800
Stop right now!

00:16:58.893 --> 00:17:00.645
- Sakura!
- Emiya, get down!

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.453
Gotta be kidding.

00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:18.745
This is...

00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:20.497
Rider?

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:28.047
Good going, Rider!

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:30.591
Keep at it and get
rid of them all!

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.179
Hey, Rider!

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:39.267
I see.

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.353
Matou's bloodline
is already obsolete,

00:17:42.603 --> 00:17:45.565
and can't produce anyone
who can handle Magecraft.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.150
I'd thought Zouken was
the one who summoned Rider

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:51.779
and had lent her to Shinji.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.157
But it was actually a
lot simpler than that.

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:57.201
Tohsaka?

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.537
In the current state
of the Matou family,

00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:02.957
the one most fit to
become a Master...

00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:08.796
...is the rightful
heir of Matou,

00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:12.508
their current Mage.
And that's you,

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:14.051
Sakura.

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:18.306
Sakura...

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:20.474
is a Master?

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:22.810
The transfer of
Command Spells...

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:26.981
A Command Spell for Rider to
obey Shinji Matou's orders...

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:31.901
With that,
Shinji has become Rider's Master.

00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:32.944
Hey..

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:36.032
Meanwhile, you lost your
authority as her Master

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:38.075
and became an ordinary Mage.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:42.371
Who are you guys looking at?

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.750
Because the Matou family is the
one that created Command Spells,

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:49.629
such a trick was possible,
wasn't it, Sakura?

00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:56.259
Hey!

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:57.887
Look over here!

00:19:00.264 --> 00:19:02.183
We haven't finished yet!

00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:04.310
One more time, Sakura!

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.605
Give me control over
her one more time!

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.527
Why are you acting so
goody-goody after all this?

00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:15.946
You have one more Command Spell!

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:17.615
Use that, and...

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:22.244
Shinji, Rider will become free from
you if you don't have Command Spells.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.205
And when that happens, even if you
make a False Attendant's Writings,

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:27.833
it'll quickly be burned up,
and that'll be it for you.

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:31.879
Because you were only controlling
her with borrowed Command Spells,

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:35.341
you were never a
Master to begin with.

00:19:42.765 --> 00:19:44.392
Shinji...

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.314
That's right.

00:19:50.564 --> 00:19:51.816
I knew that.

00:19:52.316 --> 00:19:54.442
I knew that! I knew that!

00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:55.778
I knew that!

00:19:56.237 --> 00:20:00.116
I knew all along, from the
beginning, I'd never fit this role!

00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:05.329
Since I'm not a Master,

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:07.790
you should do it.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:12.670
Kill them all in my
place, Sakura.

00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:18.300
No, Big Brother.

00:20:19.343 --> 00:20:20.803
Let's stop it here!

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:24.348
You broke your promise.

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:27.560
You said you
wouldn't kill Senpai!

00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:31.313
So, please...

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.900
Then, fine.

00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:37.319
Why don't you just...

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:38.779
die?

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:49.914
Sakura!

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:52.042
Senpai...

00:20:52.543 --> 00:20:53.627
No!

00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:55.337
Don't look at me!

00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:08.642
Sakura...

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:19.612
Looks like she can't control it.

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.324
Get away from this place!

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:26.410
If we carelessly feed her magical
energy, we can't revert her!

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:30.915
Please don't get in our way.

00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:32.583
Pull back, Rider!

00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:35.336
Your master is running
out of control!

00:21:36.086 --> 00:21:39.173
At this rate, she'll use up all her
magical energy and self-destruct!

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:43.511
It simply means she must take in more
magical energy than she's expending.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:50.392
So, a change in your master
hasn't changed your rotten nature!

00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:07.117
A barrier?

00:22:14.124 --> 00:22:15.251
Stop it.

00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:18.754
Stop this already, Rider!

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.090
I...

00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:25.302
didn't summon you because I
wanted to do something like this!

00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:28.389
I cannot abide by that command.

00:22:29.431 --> 00:22:33.394
I prioritize your life
more than anything else.

00:22:55.249 --> 00:22:58.252
No way!
Mystic Eyes of Petrification?

00:22:59.253 --> 00:23:00.254
Tohsaka!

00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:19.939
Tohsaka!

00:23:31.285 --> 00:23:35.331
Nooo!

00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:44.173
Sakuu.

00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:46.383
Ra...

00:23:58.187 --> 00:23:59.229
Sakura!

00:24:06.195 --> 00:24:07.195
Emiya,

00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:08.739
are you all right?

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.533
Tohsaka!

00:24:14.745 --> 00:24:17.122
So, you're finally awake.

00:24:17.998 --> 00:24:21.752
I just finished treatment
on Sakura Matou.

00:24:22.211 --> 00:24:23.379
How's Sakura?

00:24:23.879 --> 00:24:25.631
Is Sakura all right'?

00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:27.299
Calm down.

00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:29.927
We brought her here
with Rider's help.

00:24:30.219 --> 00:24:32.513
Kirei, how is Sakura doing?

00:24:33.013 --> 00:24:37.685
She's not stable yet,
but her life's been spared for now.

00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:41.230
Hold on a second!

00:24:41.772 --> 00:24:44.692
What happened to all
of your Magical Crests?

00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:53.325
I had no choice but to use them all
for the treatment of Sakura Matou.

00:24:53.575 --> 00:24:55.327
All of them?

00:24:56.203 --> 00:24:59.915
And the result of
that treatment...

00:25:02.459 --> 00:25:04.169
Crest Worms?

00:25:04.837 --> 00:25:07.798
What the hell are they, um...

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:11.176
Just think of them as
living Magical Circuits.

00:25:11.802 --> 00:25:14.805
A Crest Worm,
once it sinks its teeth in,

00:25:15.139 --> 00:25:21.061
infiltrates every last inch of your body,
and voraciously devours your spirit.

00:25:21.603 --> 00:25:25.274
It pierces through and
lubricates skin with its mucus,

00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:27.984
and feeds itself by stimulating

00:25:27.985 --> 00:25:31.488
then decomposing the part of
the brain controlling pleasure.

00:25:32.614 --> 00:25:33.741
As a result,

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:39.079
women swarmed by these bugs
are completely violated

00:25:39.663 --> 00:25:44.084
in both mind and body,
and thus destroyed.

00:25:45.294 --> 00:25:47.629
Sakura Matou is also.

00:25:47.755 --> 00:25:48.839
Stop it!

00:25:50.632 --> 00:25:54.178
I thought you'd need
some explanation.

00:25:55.054 --> 00:25:57.056
As long as that thing
is inside her body,

00:25:57.306 --> 00:26:01.267
her magical energy, which is her life
energy, is being sucked away limitlessly.

00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:02.853
If you leave her alone,

00:26:03.353 --> 00:26:05.481
it will ultimately kill her.

00:26:05.856 --> 00:26:08.108
The operation was a
success, right?

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:10.277
Not completely.

00:26:11.153 --> 00:26:13.197
The worms accumulated
for 11 years.

00:26:13.447 --> 00:26:17.326
If we forcefully pry them out of
her, she won't last physically.

00:26:17.826 --> 00:26:20.079
To completely be rid of them,

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:24.333
that's something you'd actually
have to rely on the Holy Grail for.

00:26:37.805 --> 00:26:39.223
Tohsaka?

00:26:43.727 --> 00:26:47.523
As the one in charge of
Fuyuki, I'll take care of her.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.237
Take care of her?

00:26:53.862 --> 00:26:56.365
You mean Sakura Matou?

00:26:56.865 --> 00:27:01.787
Yes. I can't allow Mages who can't
control their powers to live.

00:27:02.788 --> 00:27:06.083
She is already nothing more
than a Master gone mad.

00:27:06.917 --> 00:27:08.335
Even if...

00:27:08.794 --> 00:27:12.214
she is your biological
little sister?

00:27:16.844 --> 00:27:18.262
Little sister?

00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:28.063
The Tohsakas originally
had two children.

00:27:28.397 --> 00:27:31.150
But Magecraft is taught
only to one child.

00:27:32.151 --> 00:27:34.862
I inherited the Magecraft
of the Tohsakas.

00:27:35.904 --> 00:27:39.449
The Matou or Makiri family's
bloodline had already been severed.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:44.288
So Sakura was adopted by them
as the heir of the family.

00:27:44.663 --> 00:27:45.873
Then...

00:27:46.415 --> 00:27:49.251
Sakura and I are
sisters by blood.

00:27:50.627 --> 00:27:54.256
Though, we've never
called each other as such.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:58.177
Hold on, Tohsaka!
Then, all the more reason to...

00:28:05.475 --> 00:28:08.061
If I leave her alone like this,

00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:10.939
the same thing
will happen again.

00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:14.818
To strangers, next time.

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:17.279
Indiscriminately.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.615
That's why I...

00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:22.242
am going to kill her.

00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:02.157
You win, Sakura.

00:29:02.783 --> 00:29:05.285
So, I'll give you this.

00:29:30.102 --> 00:29:31.979
This is the second time...

00:29:32.646 --> 00:29:35.190
I've received
something important...

00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:38.527
from someone dear to me!

00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:53.667
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:08.807
Sakura...

00:30:09.433 --> 00:30:11.601
I've gotta find her
before Tohsaka does.

00:30:14.563 --> 00:30:15.564
But...

00:30:16.064 --> 00:30:20.027
after finding
Sakura, what am I...

00:30:24.197 --> 00:30:26.616
Good evening, Shirou.

00:30:30.037 --> 00:30:32.539
Didn't you say we
fight at night?

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.793
No. You're no longer a Master.

00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:40.130
I know everything, you see.

00:30:40.547 --> 00:30:44.551
Rider's Master has also fallen,
so only two more remain.

00:30:45.052 --> 00:30:48.138
You want to save Rider's Master,

00:30:48.388 --> 00:30:49.765
but you can't find her, right'?

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.058
Shut up!

00:31:04.821 --> 00:31:06.823
Shirou, you look like
you're going to cry.

00:31:07.908 --> 00:31:10.577
Illya, aren't you mad at me?

00:31:11.078 --> 00:31:12.454
No, I'm not.

00:31:12.954 --> 00:31:15.582
I'm on your side, Shirou.

00:31:17.918 --> 00:31:20.629
On my side?

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:24.633
You asked me this morning...

00:31:24.883 --> 00:31:28.345
about Kiritsugu...
I actually knew him.

00:31:29.054 --> 00:31:33.809
The reason I was born is
to win the Holy Grail War,

00:31:34.142 --> 00:31:38.980
but my own personal objective was
to kill Kiritsugu and you, Shirou.

00:31:40.273 --> 00:31:41.566
But...

00:31:41.983 --> 00:31:45.987
if you want to protect
someone dear to you,

00:31:46.405 --> 00:31:49.908
I'll be on your side!

00:31:50.784 --> 00:31:54.788
It's only natural to protect
the person you're in love with.

00:31:55.497 --> 00:31:58.166
I know that!

00:32:25.277 --> 00:32:32.159
I've... now lost all
places I can return to!

00:32:42.919 --> 00:32:43.920
Sakura...

00:32:48.925 --> 00:32:51.845
Senpai?

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:54.806
Sakura...

00:32:56.433 --> 00:33:00.437
Let's go home. You're not fully
over your cold yet, right?

00:33:03.064 --> 00:33:04.941
I can't go home.

00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:09.779
That thing earlier...
It wasn't a poison or anything.

00:33:10.238 --> 00:33:13.366
It's only an elixir that
heightens the senses.

00:33:14.242 --> 00:33:20.207
With only some of that,
I lost myself and hurt you!

00:33:20.749 --> 00:33:22.083
I'm not hurt at all.

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:24.586
I'm totally okay with
something like that.

00:33:26.755 --> 00:33:28.798
I am a Mage of the Matou family,

00:33:29.049 --> 00:33:31.384
and kept that fact hidden
from you for all this time!

00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:36.389
And I didn't tell you I
became a Master, either.

00:33:36.598 --> 00:33:38.558
The reason why I was going
to your place so much

00:33:38.808 --> 00:33:41.602
was because I was scared
to stand up to Grandfather!

00:33:41.603 --> 00:33:43.771
I said I was helping you out,

00:33:43.772 --> 00:33:45.649
but I've been fooling
you all along!

00:33:50.237 --> 00:33:51.613
Always...

00:33:52.155 --> 00:33:54.032
I always thought...

00:33:54.491 --> 00:33:57.661
I'm not someone who
can stay at your side.

00:33:58.912 --> 00:34:01.498
So, I kept thinking that
I'd end all of this today,

00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:05.126
and starting tomorrow,
I'd pretend I didn't know you.

00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:09.672
That I'd ignore you even if we pass
each other in the campus hallway,

00:34:09.673 --> 00:34:13.134
and pretend I didn't
know you after school.

00:34:13.385 --> 00:34:15.971
That I'd go home all by myself,

00:34:16.513 --> 00:34:19.391
and forget everything that
has happened up until now!

00:34:22.477 --> 00:34:24.437
But I couldn't do it!

00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:28.858
It was scarier than the moment when I put
a knife to my wrist to commit suicide.

00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:33.697
I was scared of deceiving you, and
I was scared of stopping the deceit!

00:34:34.364 --> 00:34:37.158
Everything around
me was just scary!

00:34:38.577 --> 00:34:41.246
I was no longer able to
take even one step forward!

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:44.165
I just didn't know
what to do at all!

00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:52.966
I wanted to protect my time together
with you going forward, as well.

00:34:54.009 --> 00:34:55.594
For me...

00:34:55.844 --> 00:34:58.471
For me,
that was the only thing...

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:02.517
that means anything to me.

00:35:11.318 --> 00:35:13.236
The person I want to protect...

00:35:13.862 --> 00:35:15.697
The person who is
important to me...

00:35:18.366 --> 00:35:21.369
If I don't want that
person to cry anymore...

00:35:23.413 --> 00:35:25.332
If nobody is going
to reprimand Sakura,

00:35:26.082 --> 00:35:29.336
and she has to
reprimand herself...

00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:32.756
I'll lead her by the hand,

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:36.343
and make sure to take
her to a brighter place.

00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:40.305
Even if nobody were
to forgive her...

00:35:48.021 --> 00:35:49.105
I Will...

00:35:50.023 --> 00:35:53.735
continue to forgive
you in your place.

00:35:55.528 --> 00:35:57.280
So don't cry anymore.

00:35:58.031 --> 00:36:01.993
I fully understand now
that you are a bad person.

00:36:05.246 --> 00:36:10.335
I don't know when I'll lose sight
of myself again, like I did earlier.

00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:13.713
I'm sure I'll do something
that'll be simply irreparable.

00:36:14.422 --> 00:36:18.760
So where are you saying someone
like me can go home to'?!

00:36:25.642 --> 00:36:28.436
This is your home, Sakura.

00:36:36.569 --> 00:36:37.946
I...

00:36:38.822 --> 00:36:40.407
I'm...

00:36:41.116 --> 00:36:43.493
not a virgin.

00:36:45.912 --> 00:36:48.915
My first time was
quite a longtime ago.

00:36:50.083 --> 00:36:51.960
That's not all.

00:36:52.252 --> 00:36:54.003
Ever since that first time,

00:36:54.254 --> 00:36:57.757
my body has been touched
by unnatural things.

00:36:58.049 --> 00:37:00.760
I don't deserve to be
protected by you'.!

00:37:07.767 --> 00:37:09.144
I will protect you.

00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:11.563
No matter what happens,

00:37:11.813 --> 00:37:14.566
even if you try
to kill yourself,

00:37:15.024 --> 00:37:17.527
I'll protect you, Sakura.

00:37:20.447 --> 00:37:22.866
Senpai...

00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:32.041
I will become a hero of
justice just for you, Sakura!

00:37:35.003 --> 00:37:37.005
You can't do that, Senpai.

00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:42.469
I'm sure I will end up
hurting you that way!

00:37:45.346 --> 00:37:47.348
I will hurt you, yet...

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:58.401
Let's go home.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.421
Sakura...

00:38:20.673 --> 00:38:21.925
Big Sis...

00:38:24.427 --> 00:38:26.387
Tohsaka-senpai...

00:38:50.078 --> 00:38:51.496
Shirou Emiya...

00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:57.210
If you kept the belief you've been
sticking with, continue to do so.

00:38:57.544 --> 00:38:59.379
The results are obvious.

00:39:00.421 --> 00:39:03.842
But if you're going to
choose a different path,

00:39:04.342 --> 00:39:06.886
there is no future
for Shirou Emiya.

00:39:08.096 --> 00:39:11.307
You will end up losing
anything and everything.

00:39:26.573 --> 00:39:29.242
You must be tired.
Take your time and rest up.

00:39:30.076 --> 00:39:32.412
O-Okay.

00:39:34.163 --> 00:39:36.291
What's wrong, Sakura?

00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:38.334
Do you have a fever?

00:39:38.793 --> 00:39:40.795
You were in the
rain for so long.

00:39:41.796 --> 00:39:45.300
I-It's not a cold.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.886
My magical energy is a bit...

00:39:48.553 --> 00:39:49.846
lacking.

00:39:52.932 --> 00:39:56.436
Is there anything I
can help you with?

00:39:58.146 --> 00:39:59.647
Um...

00:40:03.693 --> 00:40:05.320
Would you like to...

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:12.076
No! I'll be fine if you could give
me a small amount of your blood.

00:40:12.744 --> 00:40:14.746
S-Sure.

00:40:17.874 --> 00:40:18.874
Is this okay?

00:40:20.668 --> 00:40:21.753
Yes.

00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:50.865
Are you Okay?

00:40:58.498 --> 00:41:00.291
I-I see.

00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:03.878
Well then, g-good night.

00:41:04.963 --> 00:41:06.381
Okay.

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:20.395
I shouldn't go any further!

00:41:21.896 --> 00:41:24.565
I can't contaminate
him any more than this!

00:41:51.467 --> 00:41:53.886
Sakura,
can you make a soup stock?

00:41:54.721 --> 00:41:55.722
Okay!

00:41:56.931 --> 00:41:59.017
What about the spinach?

00:41:59.267 --> 00:42:01.394
Let's dress it
with sesame today.

00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:03.938
Sakura, eggs.

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:05.188
Here!

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.070
- Thank you for the meal!
- Thank you for the meal!

00:42:18.661 --> 00:42:21.914
It's been a while since
we did this last time.

00:42:22.915 --> 00:42:24.000
Yes.

00:42:27.795 --> 00:42:29.172
You're not gonna eat?

00:42:29.797 --> 00:42:32.175
It's okay. Don't be shy.

00:42:34.927 --> 00:42:39.432
We Servants don't require the intake
of nutrients the same way you do.

00:42:39.932 --> 00:42:41.017
Is that so?

00:42:41.434 --> 00:42:43.936
Saber used to eat a lot.

00:42:46.689 --> 00:42:49.817
Your way doesn't suit me.

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:51.944
Well then,

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.946
if that's the case...

00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:06.667
For our strategy from now on...

00:43:07.293 --> 00:43:09.378
I will have Sakura win,

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.672
and have her use the Holy Grail.

00:43:12.548 --> 00:43:16.135
But I think Sakura had
better not go outside.

00:43:16.636 --> 00:43:19.597
It'd be dangerous if she
saw Zouken in person.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:22.975
I believe that idea is correct.

00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:28.022
However,
how will you defeat that Mage?

00:43:30.566 --> 00:43:34.028
I think we should cooperate
with the other Masters.

00:43:34.779 --> 00:43:37.990
Who else is left?

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:42.495
Tohsaka's Archer,
Sakura's Rider...

00:43:43.371 --> 00:43:46.082
Zouken has his Assassin in tow.

00:43:46.833 --> 00:43:49.127
Other than that, Illya's...

00:43:49.585 --> 00:43:51.045
Berserker.

00:43:55.842 --> 00:43:57.844
Is it going to be all right?

00:43:58.261 --> 00:43:59.971
Yeah, probably.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.850
Don't go outside, okay?

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:13.442
Are you regretting this?

00:44:15.862 --> 00:44:19.907
I can't have regrets
after coming this far.

00:44:20.408 --> 00:44:25.538
Rider, if things get dangerous,
bring Senpai back home.

00:44:26.998 --> 00:44:28.374
But Sakura...

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.836
I think the one we should
be careful of is...

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:35.715
that priest instead
of the elderly man.

00:44:38.134 --> 00:44:39.635
Right.

00:44:39.886 --> 00:44:43.264
I actually think so, as well.

00:44:44.265 --> 00:44:47.518
But rest assured, Rider.

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:52.440
Because there's no way
he can win against me.

00:44:55.818 --> 00:44:56.818
Well then...

00:45:41.489 --> 00:45:43.658
Senpai!

00:46:04.845 --> 00:46:08.975
I got it! All I have to do is
keep him from going outside.

00:46:09.225 --> 00:46:13.729
That way, he won't be in
any danger again, right?

00:46:17.024 --> 00:46:18.109
Huh?

00:46:18.359 --> 00:46:22.029
What was I just thinking about?

00:46:47.888 --> 00:46:50.850
Talk about rough trekking.

00:46:59.984 --> 00:47:01.902
Guess it wants me to
follow, huh'?

00:47:12.246 --> 00:47:13.246
Huh?

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:17.209
It's gone.

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:25.676
What happened to this?

00:48:09.178 --> 00:48:13.516
You sure are a cowardly
Servant, much like your master.

00:48:13.933 --> 00:48:17.186
I can't feel any intent
to fight against us.

00:48:18.687 --> 00:48:21.607
Do you value your
life that much?

00:48:23.025 --> 00:48:25.528
Of course I do.

00:48:27.321 --> 00:48:30.074
My wish is for eternal life.

00:48:30.658 --> 00:48:33.035
Look at this body!

00:48:33.452 --> 00:48:36.704
With each moment it rots,
emitting a foul odor,

00:48:36.705 --> 00:48:39.917
losing the knowledge I
have stashed away within.

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:46.215
Do you understand the pain of rotting
away while you're still alive?

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:51.053
No human is fearless of death.

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:58.602
If that was going
to grant me my wish,

00:49:00.396 --> 00:49:05.734
I would run around the entire world
killing every human one by one.

00:49:12.366 --> 00:49:13.784
I'm disgusted.

00:49:14.743 --> 00:49:19.248
You have lost sight of
things that much, Makiri?

00:49:20.249 --> 00:49:23.502
Remember again what we
earnestly wished for.

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:27.756
Remember where our thirst for
achieving the miracle came from.

00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:32.927
And why we've been striving to reach
the point where we're not human...

00:49:32.928 --> 00:49:36.515
while keeping our human bodies.

00:49:41.604 --> 00:49:44.648
Quite the words
from a mere puppet.

00:49:44.982 --> 00:49:48.611
Of course they've
pre-programmed you, huh?

00:49:49.778 --> 00:49:52.031
Playtime is now over.

00:49:53.449 --> 00:49:58.579
I, Zouken Matou, will take
the Einzberns' Holy Grail.

00:50:29.443 --> 00:50:31.237
No, don't, Berserker!

00:50:56.136 --> 00:50:58.597
Tohsaka! Why?

00:50:59.098 --> 00:51:02.935
I never thought you'd come
up with the same idea, Emiya.

00:51:30.379 --> 00:51:31.839
Gotta be kidding me!

00:51:50.816 --> 00:51:52.483
Get away from there!

00:51:52.484 --> 00:51:55.487
If that thing gets you,
you won't be able to come back!

00:52:08.542 --> 00:52:10.669
The score has been settled.

00:52:11.211 --> 00:52:12.838
I'll leave you to do the rest.

00:52:13.088 --> 00:52:17.676
Don't let the Einzbern girl
go after all this effort.

00:52:28.687 --> 00:52:29.855
Berserker!

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:39.990
Illya!

00:52:55.255 --> 00:52:57.925
Jeez, Archer...

00:53:01.762 --> 00:53:03.055
Berserker...

00:53:15.609 --> 00:53:18.737
I will be your opponent.

00:53:25.577 --> 00:53:26.787
Archer!

00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:30.124
I'm counting on you.

00:54:00.446 --> 00:54:01.488
This is the end.

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:12.040
A genuine Heroic Spirit...

00:54:12.458 --> 00:54:15.085
could not fight the Cursed
Boundary Layer of that thing.

00:54:15.586 --> 00:54:20.299
At present, you are not much different
from the phantoms filling this forest.

00:54:41.153 --> 00:54:42.446
Berserker!

00:54:50.954 --> 00:54:52.498
This doesn't look good.

00:54:54.041 --> 00:54:55.501
Berserker...

00:54:56.043 --> 00:54:57.294
Berserker...

00:54:58.128 --> 00:55:01.840
Berserker!

00:58:49.578 --> 00:58:52.373
No... No!

00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:32.913
My duties are complete.

00:59:33.289 --> 00:59:35.458
I will leave you to do the rest.

00:59:35.958 --> 00:59:39.462
How gracious of you. I can
regain the points I have lost.

00:59:44.133 --> 00:59:45.968
Saber!

01:00:05.696 --> 01:00:06.696
Illya!

01:00:21.587 --> 01:00:22.755
That's far enough.

01:00:23.297 --> 01:00:25.591
You're of no use.

01:00:33.432 --> 01:00:36.519
You can't kill a puny boy unless
you do a sneak attack, can you?

01:00:36.727 --> 01:00:38.229
Pathetic.

01:00:40.815 --> 01:00:43.901
How could you come here?

01:00:44.401 --> 01:00:45.653
Who knows?

01:00:45.903 --> 01:00:47.196
Archer!

01:00:48.697 --> 01:00:49.697
Hurry!

01:00:50.574 --> 01:00:52.785
If that thing catches
up, it's all over!

01:01:02.002 --> 01:01:04.964
We'll talk later. Run, brat!

01:01:05.506 --> 01:01:07.466
Now that you've
taken Illya's hand,

01:01:07.716 --> 01:01:09.635
protect her until the very end!

01:01:17.768 --> 01:01:18.768
Let's so!

01:01:40.249 --> 01:01:41.417
How?

01:01:42.501 --> 01:01:44.169
How are you able to move?

01:01:46.046 --> 01:01:47.673
That's obvious.

01:01:48.215 --> 01:01:52.261
I am not a proper Heroic
Spirit like the others.

01:01:52.678 --> 01:01:56.765
As I am not canonical, a little
defilement won't affect me.

01:01:57.016 --> 01:02:01.270
Which means that I am also
a distorted Heroic Spirit!

01:02:23.125 --> 01:02:24.877
Good job, Archer!

01:02:25.669 --> 01:02:27.880
You can return to
spirit form now.

01:02:28.422 --> 01:02:29.702
We have to hurry up and get out.

01:02:30.799 --> 01:02:31.799
Tohsak...

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:40.850
No...

01:02:44.021 --> 01:02:45.522
Archer!

01:02:49.068 --> 01:02:50.152
Tohsaka!

01:02:52.863 --> 01:02:56.033
Hurry up and get out of
here, fool!

01:03:07.461 --> 01:03:09.338
Magical energy is gathering!

01:03:09.838 --> 01:03:11.090
If this keeps going...

01:03:14.426 --> 01:03:16.011
Run, Tohsaka!

01:03:24.561 --> 01:03:29.274
I am the bone of my sword.

01:03:29.608 --> 01:03:32.027
Steel is my body.

01:03:33.529 --> 01:03:38.033
I have created over
a thousand blades.

01:03:44.456 --> 01:03:47.376
Rho Aias!

01:04:28.584 --> 01:04:29.960
Shirou...

01:04:33.464 --> 01:04:34.840
Why?

01:04:35.591 --> 01:04:37.092
Shirou!

01:04:39.845 --> 01:04:41.138
Shirou!

01:04:41.722 --> 01:04:43.140
Shiroul!

01:04:49.897 --> 01:04:51.482
I guess this is it for me.

01:04:54.902 --> 01:04:58.238
Take care, Tohsaka.

01:05:17.174 --> 01:05:18.717
Are you insane?

01:05:23.972 --> 01:05:26.683
If you did such a
thing, you would...

01:05:28.185 --> 01:05:30.312
Not even worth a thought.

01:05:30.604 --> 01:05:33.816
If I do nothing,
two will be dead.

01:05:34.191 --> 01:05:37.694
But this way, at least one
will definitely be saved.

01:05:50.916 --> 01:05:53.252
I'm home, Sakura.

01:05:54.503 --> 01:05:55.963
Oh, right.

01:05:56.213 --> 01:05:58.757
Of course you're surprised
that I look like this.

01:05:59.007 --> 01:06:01.677
Yeah, I got slightly injured.

01:06:02.511 --> 01:06:04.847
It looks terrible because
it's bandaged so heavily,

01:06:04.972 --> 01:06:08.142
but it's really not
that big a deal.

01:06:12.855 --> 01:06:14.857
I saw Tohsaka while I was out.

01:06:15.357 --> 01:06:18.360
She helped me out,
and we have a cease-fire for now.

01:06:19.486 --> 01:06:21.864
And this is Illya.

01:06:22.364 --> 01:06:25.117
Sorry to be so sudden, but...

01:06:26.243 --> 01:06:27.327
Sakura?

01:06:32.332 --> 01:06:34.001
Can you move your arm?

01:06:35.085 --> 01:06:36.085
No.

01:06:36.253 --> 01:06:37.546
Thought so.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:42.551
Transplanting a body part of a
Servant onto a human is unheard-of.

01:06:43.927 --> 01:06:44.928
Listen.

01:06:45.179 --> 01:06:49.725
If you use that arm even once, Archer's
Magical Circuits will activate.

01:06:50.058 --> 01:06:54.062
And your body won't be able to
withstand the power from them,

01:06:54.313 --> 01:06:56.190
and you'll collapse
from the inside.

01:06:57.941 --> 01:07:00.235
Then, this cloth is...

01:07:00.652 --> 01:07:01.945
It's a seal.

01:07:05.449 --> 01:07:07.743
Tohsaka, thank you.

01:07:08.827 --> 01:07:11.455
Wh-What's this so suddenly?

01:07:12.331 --> 01:07:15.834
I'm going to work with you
until we defeat Zouken.

01:07:16.126 --> 01:07:20.589
And besides, it's convenient
for me to stay close to her.

01:07:22.049 --> 01:07:25.761
You're concerned about Sakura.

01:07:26.345 --> 01:07:28.222
I'm telling you, that's...

01:07:29.389 --> 01:07:32.601
Besides, if I didn't
become a Master myself,

01:07:32.851 --> 01:07:35.646
I'd never have gotten
to know you like this.

01:07:38.106 --> 01:07:40.400
That's a little different
from what you think.

01:07:42.027 --> 01:07:43.904
I don't know about you,

01:07:44.238 --> 01:07:47.908
but I've known about you
for quite a while now.

01:07:50.535 --> 01:07:52.663
I think it was about
four years ago.

01:07:52.913 --> 01:07:57.793
You were doing the high jump over
and over until sunset, weren't you?

01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.754
I happened to be there.

01:08:02.923 --> 01:08:04.507
There was an idiot
who kept jumping

01:08:04.508 --> 01:08:06.301
even though it was
obvious he couldn't do it.

01:08:06.677 --> 01:08:09.137
And I was watching
him like an idiot.

01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:15.644
I usually back off from things if I
find them impossible for me to do.

01:08:15.936 --> 01:08:17.980
I'm cold through and through.

01:08:18.939 --> 01:08:21.566
But you know,
I'm a Mage after all.

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:26.488
So, I was about to compromise, like, "Oh,
well, my life can be fine as it is now."

01:08:26.863 --> 01:08:30.242
But that was just when I saw
someone who was my polar opposite.

01:08:30.784 --> 01:08:32.869
I was pretty shocked, you know?

01:08:50.595 --> 01:08:52.222
Don't take it away from me.

01:08:55.517 --> 01:08:59.688
Don't take that memory away
from me along with other things!

01:09:13.577 --> 01:09:14.703
Ow.

01:09:25.881 --> 01:09:27.716
What if I take this cloth off?

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.552
My arm might be back to
normal, huh?

01:09:52.449 --> 01:09:53.950
No...

01:09:54.951 --> 01:09:56.495
This is...

01:09:58.955 --> 01:10:00.374
no good.

01:10:09.466 --> 01:10:10.842
Shirou...

01:10:13.595 --> 01:10:16.848
There is something
I'd like to ask you.

01:10:18.266 --> 01:10:23.313
Sakuras happiness is to have you
stay alive and stay by her side.

01:10:23.563 --> 01:10:27.109
She wishes nothing else.

01:10:27.567 --> 01:10:31.071
I'm wishing for her survival.

01:10:31.947 --> 01:10:35.117
I am rather fond of her.

01:10:40.163 --> 01:10:44.167
Shirou, do you side with Sakura?

01:10:45.877 --> 01:10:50.006
Will you, no matter what
happens in times to come?

01:10:54.261 --> 01:10:55.637
Senpai...

01:10:59.307 --> 01:11:00.559
Sakura?

01:11:05.147 --> 01:11:08.150
Oh, you're low on magical
energy, huh?

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.485
You can step inside
and wait for me.

01:11:11.445 --> 01:11:15.282
Let's see.
Where did I put that cutter-knife'?

01:11:44.394 --> 01:11:46.771
S-Sakura?

01:11:49.107 --> 01:11:55.322
Senpai,
why are you protecting me?

01:11:57.616 --> 01:11:59.034
It's because...

01:12:01.369 --> 01:12:04.873
I'm the one who
wants you by my side.

01:12:06.208 --> 01:12:08.627
I need you,

01:12:09.628 --> 01:12:13.548
and I don't think we could
stay far from each other.

01:12:15.133 --> 01:12:18.637
Do you mean you like me as
one of your family members?

01:12:19.054 --> 01:12:20.472
Or...

01:12:21.223 --> 01:12:24.726
as a girl?

01:12:30.232 --> 01:12:34.569
Yeah. I love you, Sakura.

01:12:39.533 --> 01:12:40.700
Then,

01:12:41.159 --> 01:12:42.577
please make love to me.

01:12:50.335 --> 01:12:55.590
Senpai, am I impure?

01:12:56.841 --> 01:12:59.844
It's so strange.

01:13:00.971 --> 01:13:06.851
I end up like this just
by coming into your room.

01:13:07.602 --> 01:13:12.107
I try to quench it by myself,
but it just won't subside.

01:13:12.482 --> 01:13:16.111
I can't think of anything
other than you, Senpai!

01:13:17.487 --> 01:13:20.865
I'm such a defiled...

01:13:24.661 --> 01:13:25.829
No.

01:13:26.371 --> 01:13:28.373
You're not defiled at all.

01:13:29.916 --> 01:13:31.793
You're beautiful, Sakura.

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.380
Senpai...

01:14:04.743 --> 01:14:05.910
I...

01:14:06.494 --> 01:14:07.912
can't take it.

01:14:08.455 --> 01:14:09.914
When Big Sister...

01:14:10.415 --> 01:14:13.126
took you out earlier,

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:16.671
I became terribly
frightened just by that!

01:14:33.021 --> 01:14:36.399
I'm sorry I didn't notice.

01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:44.532
Senpai...

01:14:58.505 --> 01:14:59.923
Sakura...

01:15:06.346 --> 01:15:09.683
I love you, Senpai.

01:15:18.733 --> 01:15:20.568
Time for a blessing.

01:15:21.653 --> 01:15:23.655
Blessing?

01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:27.742
For what?

01:15:28.284 --> 01:15:31.829
For the other Holy Grail
that is about to be born.

01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:35.291
And it has conceived all
the evil in this world

01:15:35.542 --> 01:15:42.340
that was born from people,
yet never been wanted by them.

01:15:42.924 --> 01:15:45.093
The whereabouts
of good and evil.

01:15:45.343 --> 01:15:47.303
If it gives birth to
something that can answer

01:15:47.429 --> 01:15:50.765
instead of answering
the question itself,

01:15:50.890 --> 01:15:52.350
what do you think would happen?

01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:58.356
The answer is near.

01:15:58.773 --> 01:16:03.069
And what if this question
blasphemes against God?

01:16:03.778 --> 01:16:07.490
Then, in front of God,
I would give every bit of myself,

01:16:08.533 --> 01:16:11.578
and I shall question
even my Lord until death.

01:16:18.376 --> 01:16:22.589
Since you let me stay here, I'll
at least make breakfast for all.

01:16:31.264 --> 01:16:35.101
I'll go help Tohsaka-senpai.

01:16:35.351 --> 01:16:37.020
Oh, Sakura...

01:16:38.772 --> 01:16:39.898
Yes?

01:16:40.273 --> 01:16:42.650
You know, for Tohsaka...

01:16:43.359 --> 01:16:46.404
Now, what to do...

01:16:50.241 --> 01:16:53.953
Big Sister,
I'll wash the vegetables over here.

01:16:54.245 --> 01:16:56.664
Yes, please do...

01:17:04.297 --> 01:17:06.841
Is it strange after all,

01:17:07.342 --> 01:17:08.676
Big Sister?

01:17:10.303 --> 01:17:14.307
Th-Th-Th-There's nothing
strange about that!

01:17:23.942 --> 01:17:27.362
Illya, about that thing...
Can we do it in my room?

01:17:28.613 --> 01:17:30.573
What is "that thing"?

01:17:30.824 --> 01:17:35.703
I thought we'd need one or two
secret weapons up our sleeve.

01:17:36.204 --> 01:17:40.708
Archer's arm contains knowledge
of the Einzberns, you know?

01:17:41.459 --> 01:17:46.381
I suggested to Tohsaka that there might
be something to make good use of it.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:51.302
I have no interest in what
Kischur Zelretch left behind,

01:17:53.263 --> 01:17:58.351
but a treasure box that
he left may be pretty.

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:02.981
Kischur Zel...?

01:18:04.524 --> 01:18:05.984
Senpai...

01:18:07.777 --> 01:18:09.279
Um...

01:18:09.654 --> 01:18:12.073
Thank you very much.

01:18:14.909 --> 01:18:17.871
I'd always just
watched her from afar.

01:18:18.121 --> 01:18:23.251
I never thought that a day would come
when I could call her "Big Sister."

01:18:24.544 --> 01:18:29.507
You had no interaction with Tohsaka after
you were adopted into the Matou family?

01:18:29.757 --> 01:18:30.925
No.

01:18:31.217 --> 01:18:37.557
Both Big Sister and I merely
knew we were sisters as a fact.

01:18:37.807 --> 01:18:41.436
We both tried our best not
to interact with each other.

01:18:43.605 --> 01:18:47.358
Besides, if she found out
what kind of Magecraft I use,

01:18:47.609 --> 01:18:49.360
I'm sure she'll hate me.

01:18:50.486 --> 01:18:53.990
Hate you? Why would that be?

01:18:57.243 --> 01:19:03.416
Every single Matou's Magecraft technique
is to pillage from others to start with.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.463
All we do is pillage, and there's no skill
to be taught to give back to others.

01:19:10.256 --> 01:19:14.302
Sakura, do you dislike the
Magecraft of the Matou family?

01:19:15.303 --> 01:19:19.015
Their teachings
were indeed strict,

01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:23.353
but it's nothing compared to
you, Senpai.

01:19:24.312 --> 01:19:30.360
I once saw you training
so hard at night.

01:19:31.778 --> 01:19:36.240
I felt so many times
that I had to stop you.

01:19:37.909 --> 01:19:41.663
Your training was a
very dangerous one.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.080
It was...

01:19:43.539 --> 01:19:47.502
as if you were piercing
through your own throat.

01:19:48.711 --> 01:19:51.923
Even though no one
forced you to do so,

01:19:52.215 --> 01:19:56.219
you stubbornly kept at it for
the longest time all by yourself.

01:19:57.220 --> 01:20:02.558
I'm sure that among us,
you are the strongest one.

01:20:03.893 --> 01:20:05.812
Not because of any
Magecraft affixes,

01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:09.607
but because the very nature
of your heart is so pure.

01:20:19.951 --> 01:20:23.413
I've known since the
day we first met...

01:20:24.414 --> 01:20:30.253
that you would
never betray anyone.

01:20:37.301 --> 01:20:41.431
You took her from me, Emiya!

01:21:04.912 --> 01:21:07.415
Why won't...

01:21:08.082 --> 01:21:10.168
anything happen?

01:21:24.891 --> 01:21:29.604
MULTIPLE CORPSES IN
NEW CITY CENTRAL PARK

01:21:29.771 --> 01:21:32.356
at Central Park in the New
City district of Fuyuki.

01:21:32.607 --> 01:21:33.899
There were four victims,

01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:35.484
The weeds have turned black!

01:21:35.485 --> 01:21:36.151
And they are currently investigating
on their causes of death...

01:21:36.152 --> 01:21:41.282
That means that Zouken
had the shadow do this?

01:21:41.532 --> 01:21:42.950
I don't know about that.

01:21:43.201 --> 01:21:45.953
I don't think he'd leave
behind evidence like this.

01:21:48.831 --> 01:21:50.416
Next up is tomorrow's weather.

01:21:50.666 --> 01:21:52.667
Miss Sato from the weather
forecasting center?

01:21:52.668 --> 01:21:53.795
Yes. Here's the weather.

01:21:55.004 --> 01:21:56.130
Huh?

01:21:56.714 --> 01:21:58.633
I don't taste anything.

01:22:05.765 --> 01:22:07.391
So warm...

01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:12.438
It's fine.
I can still feel this.

01:22:14.774 --> 01:22:19.112
I wish this moment
would continue forever.

01:22:59.110 --> 01:23:01.320
Walking along, flip-flop.

01:23:02.029 --> 01:23:04.615
An empty head sways to and fro.

01:23:04.866 --> 01:23:08.619
Vacating all the
nitty-gritty objectives.

01:23:09.162 --> 01:23:12.456
Trembling,
shimmy-shimmy and a go-go.

01:23:12.832 --> 01:23:15.960
Singing, tee-bee and a 30-30.

01:23:16.586 --> 01:23:20.131
Dried-out limbs,
just like paper balloons,

01:23:20.464 --> 01:23:23.551
roll around the
ground, tumble-tumble.

01:23:24.177 --> 01:23:28.556
Huff-puff, floating and flying
is when you become an adult.

01:23:29.056 --> 01:23:30.558
Go-go.

01:23:31.434 --> 01:23:33.019
Go-go.

01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:35.646
Go-go.

01:24:03.132 --> 01:24:05.760
Someone is coming
by, squeak-squeak.

01:24:06.886 --> 01:24:09.388
A laughter,
cackle-cackle-cackle-cackle.

01:24:09.889 --> 01:24:13.226
I don't remember
fascinating you at all!

01:24:31.452 --> 01:24:34.080
Because they echo so
loudly, scritch -scratch...

01:24:42.296 --> 01:24:45.049
the tummy started
to rumble-grumble.

01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:54.642
You're working hard, aren't you?

01:24:55.434 --> 01:24:58.604
That's why I told you to
die before it's too late.

01:25:12.952 --> 01:25:14.078
Twinkle-twinkle...

01:25:14.287 --> 01:25:15.454
So beautiful...

01:25:27.508 --> 01:25:29.385
The grace period is now over.

01:25:30.011 --> 01:25:32.430
This is my mercy to you.

01:25:53.868 --> 01:25:57.580
What? You're still breathing?

01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.706
I wasn't expecting your body,

01:25:59.707 --> 01:26:01.959
not just the shadow,
to be in the transformation phase.

01:26:31.697 --> 01:26:34.116
To think you'd attempt
to make me kneel!

01:27:07.817 --> 01:27:09.402
Damn you!

01:27:29.255 --> 01:27:33.175
Surely you haven't
gone that far!

01:28:04.748 --> 01:28:06.333
Did you see that?

01:28:07.751 --> 01:28:08.751
Huh?

01:28:32.318 --> 01:28:33.527
Shirou!

01:28:35.571 --> 01:28:37.323
Come to the living
room right away!

01:28:43.204 --> 01:28:45.246
Around 22-'30 tonight,

01:28:45.247 --> 01:28:48.541
IN FRONT OF THE NEW CITY STATION
there Was a Widespread blackout near the New City Station.

01:28:48.542 --> 01:28:49.209
IN FRONT OF THE NEW CITY STATION

01:28:49.210 --> 01:28:52.921
There are also multiple incomprehensible
reports to the police...

01:28:52.922 --> 01:28:54.715
about neighbors disappearing,

01:28:54.965 --> 01:28:58.427
people gone missing or
people suddenly vanishing.

01:29:05.768 --> 01:29:06.768
Sakura!

01:29:08.103 --> 01:29:10.856
Hold on! I'll get med!

01:29:11.607 --> 01:29:12.607
Saku...

01:29:17.696 --> 01:29:18.906
Don't notice.

01:29:20.783 --> 01:29:21.783
Stop!

01:29:30.292 --> 01:29:33.212
Don't think that
it looks like her!

01:29:35.756 --> 01:29:38.259
Over 60 victims have
already been confirmed.

01:29:38.425 --> 01:29:45.933
The residents of roughly 40
buildings are unaccounted for.

01:29:48.686 --> 01:29:49.979
How is Sakura?

01:29:51.730 --> 01:29:53.107
She's alive.

01:29:56.777 --> 01:29:57.987
However...

01:29:58.654 --> 01:30:00.781
Something wrong?

01:30:01.615 --> 01:30:05.953
Sakura's body is just connected
to look fine on the outside.

01:30:06.203 --> 01:30:08.622
The muscles in her arms and
legs are completely tattered.

01:30:09.373 --> 01:30:12.835
I'm positive that she died
at some point for sure.

01:30:14.545 --> 01:30:17.298
I don't know who got her.

01:30:17.423 --> 01:30:21.552
But the pain may have destroyed not
only her body, but her brain, as well.

01:30:23.137 --> 01:30:27.349
We have to defeat Zouken and
that shadow as quickly as we can.

01:30:28.642 --> 01:30:31.103
Let's do everything in
our power to do that.

01:30:37.109 --> 01:30:39.111
But Shirou...

01:30:40.404 --> 01:30:45.659
What if Zouken and that black shadow
are completely different things?

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:47.745
What will you do then?

01:31:01.842 --> 01:31:02.968
Good morning.

01:31:03.385 --> 01:31:06.472
Do you still have a sense
of yourself left, Sakura?

01:31:08.098 --> 01:31:10.976
Where in the world did you
take in a soul like that?

01:31:11.518 --> 01:31:14.229
Assassin and Rider
are still around,

01:31:14.772 --> 01:31:17.608
but you're sufficiently satisfied?
This is a surprise.

01:31:22.279 --> 01:31:26.659
Sakura, do you know what's
going to happen to you?

01:31:28.202 --> 01:31:29.787
I don't.

01:31:30.245 --> 01:31:32.623
What's going to happen to me?

01:31:33.374 --> 01:31:34.500
You'll die.

01:31:34.875 --> 01:31:36.794
You can't be saved
no matter what.

01:31:47.096 --> 01:31:48.639
I'm home!

01:31:48.889 --> 01:31:51.100
I made it back at
least a little bit!

01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:55.396
Wait, Shirou, you're not home?

01:31:57.314 --> 01:31:58.482
Who's that?

01:32:01.026 --> 01:32:02.319
Jeez!

01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:05.572
Where did Shirou go?

01:32:05.823 --> 01:32:08.409
When Sakura is very sick!

01:32:12.788 --> 01:32:15.082
Oh, you shouldn't! Don't get up.

01:32:15.207 --> 01:32:17.084
Senpai said...

01:32:17.584 --> 01:32:21.088
he was going to protect me.

01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:24.425
However...

01:32:25.676 --> 01:32:27.177
I'm sorry,

01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:32.933
because of me,
his dreams will be shattered!

01:32:35.436 --> 01:32:36.729
How so?

01:32:38.147 --> 01:32:39.690
Because“.

01:32:40.816 --> 01:32:43.986
I'm a bad person.

01:32:45.195 --> 01:32:50.117
Shirou can properly scold you and tell
you that you shouldn't do bad things.

01:32:51.243 --> 01:32:55.998
Sakura, you want to fix all the bad
things about you, too, don't you?

01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:58.208
Yes.

01:32:59.168 --> 01:33:01.128
Then no worries.

01:33:02.171 --> 01:33:05.758
Besides, Shirou's dream is to
be a hero of justice, right'?

01:33:06.258 --> 01:33:09.303
Of course he has someone
he wants to protect!

01:33:10.262 --> 01:33:14.266
But that means he'd
protect everyone equally.

01:33:14.516 --> 01:33:17.478
If Shirou is aiming to
become like Kiritsugu,

01:33:18.061 --> 01:33:21.523
it's totally all right for
him to have someone special.

01:33:25.277 --> 01:33:29.448
Kiritsugu played
favorites, too, you know!

01:33:31.450 --> 01:33:34.036
Even after he started
living in this city,

01:33:34.369 --> 01:33:39.500
Kiritsugu went overseas
over and over again.

01:33:40.584 --> 01:33:44.296
All the way until he could
no longer move his body.

01:33:48.050 --> 01:33:52.429
I'm sure there was someone
he desperately wanted to see.

01:33:56.558 --> 01:34:01.146
It's a very painful thing to not be able
to see someone you really care about.

01:34:02.022 --> 01:34:04.191
Even for a hero of justice.

01:34:08.278 --> 01:34:09.863
That's why...

01:34:10.781 --> 01:34:15.494
Sakura,
please stay by Shirou's side.

01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:35.055
Are you going to betray?

01:34:42.187 --> 01:34:45.899
Are you going to betray
who you used to be?

01:34:53.115 --> 01:34:54.241
Hey..

01:34:58.745 --> 01:34:59.913
Stop it!

01:35:01.248 --> 01:35:03.417
If your answer is "yes" ..

01:35:05.210 --> 01:35:06.503
You are...

01:35:08.505 --> 01:35:10.465
Stop it!

01:35:21.810 --> 01:35:23.395
No way!

01:35:23.645 --> 01:35:26.523
That just can't be!

01:35:32.237 --> 01:35:33.780
Shirou Emiya...

01:35:34.197 --> 01:35:35.449
Is that right?

01:35:36.283 --> 01:35:38.619
My Lord Mage would
like to speak with you.

01:35:55.677 --> 01:35:58.138
Well, you arrived
earlier than I thought,

01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:00.599
Emma's boy.

01:36:01.975 --> 01:36:03.185
Zoukenn.

01:36:04.436 --> 01:36:06.688
There is only one
thing I will say!

01:36:07.814 --> 01:36:10.233
Release Sakura immediately!

01:36:11.234 --> 01:36:12.945
Release, huh?

01:36:13.195 --> 01:36:15.697
I guess you could
put it that way.

01:36:18.659 --> 01:36:20.410
Shirou Emiya,

01:36:21.119 --> 01:36:24.373
I called you here today because
I wish to ask you for a favor.

01:36:25.290 --> 01:36:28.961
I'd like you to
kill that shadow.

01:36:31.421 --> 01:36:34.174
Isn't that thing
one of your allies?

01:36:35.008 --> 01:36:36.593
An ally?

01:36:36.969 --> 01:36:40.472
As if I could communicate
with that thing.

01:36:41.223 --> 01:36:44.935
I can't even calm it
down since last night.

01:36:47.396 --> 01:36:54.361
Oh, before all that, I should tell
you what exactly that shadow is.

01:36:54.903 --> 01:36:59.866
Bluntly put, that thing is
the content of the Holy Grail.

01:37:01.493 --> 01:37:04.830
The "will" that is overflowing from
the gate called the "Holy Grail."

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:07.749
That's what that shadow is.

01:37:08.959 --> 01:37:10.293
The shadow...

01:37:10.711 --> 01:37:11.712
and the gate...

01:37:12.963 --> 01:37:18.218
I asked you to kill the shadow,
but that will be a difficult task.

01:37:19.261 --> 01:37:20.387
However,

01:37:21.221 --> 01:37:23.932
you're still able
to kill the gate.

01:37:26.351 --> 01:37:29.813
It will catch on if it were
to be me or Tohsaka's girl.

01:37:30.230 --> 01:37:33.442
Servants would be nothing
more than its feed.

01:37:34.192 --> 01:37:35.360
Stop it!

01:37:36.319 --> 01:37:39.406
The only one who can implant a
piece of the Holy Grail in it,

01:37:39.656 --> 01:37:46.246
and kill the "Holy Grail of Matou" that
I nurtured for the last ten years.

01:37:46.371 --> 01:37:47.998
Stop!!

01:37:50.042 --> 01:37:52.252
You have been aware,
haven't you...

01:37:53.211 --> 01:37:56.590
that it resembles Sakura?

01:38:02.512 --> 01:38:05.891
The doll that doesn't do
anything but exists here...

01:38:06.141 --> 01:38:09.394
will come to an end by the
hands of its beloved man.

01:38:09.686 --> 01:38:11.813
Surely it will be the happiest.

01:38:13.482 --> 01:38:15.150
We have no time left.

01:38:15.942 --> 01:38:18.653
Once Sakura's
conscience is gone,

01:38:19.029 --> 01:38:23.825
the Holy Grail that has been residing
in her unconscious will surface.

01:38:24.409 --> 01:38:28.497
And the catastrophe of ten
years ago will be replicated.

01:38:31.333 --> 01:38:33.919
If you want to save Sakura,

01:38:34.169 --> 01:38:38.173
you must persevere until the time limit
for the Holy Grail War is reached.

01:38:38.799 --> 01:38:43.428
Judging from past examples, that
should be about four more days' time.

01:38:44.304 --> 01:38:45.305
Thoughts?

01:38:45.555 --> 01:38:48.016
Do you think Sakura
will last that long?

01:38:48.934 --> 01:38:51.812
She will! Of course she will!

01:38:52.646 --> 01:38:56.399
But other people may
not last that long.

01:38:56.775 --> 01:39:01.571
It may be full now from
the gorging last night,

01:39:01.863 --> 01:39:05.408
but it will be on the move
again as soon as tomorrow.

01:39:06.952 --> 01:39:08.869
How many more days will it be

01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:12.916
before every human in this
city has been devoured?

01:39:15.210 --> 01:39:16.962
You surely understand?

01:39:17.712 --> 01:39:20.590
Vanquishing evil to
save everyone else.

01:39:20.882 --> 01:39:24.511
If you would like to
succeed Kiritsugu Emiya,

01:39:25.595 --> 01:39:28.265
no one but Sakura Matou...

01:39:28.890 --> 01:39:30.934
is your true enemy.

01:39:54.708 --> 01:39:57.294
Sakura, are you awake?

01:40:01.006 --> 01:40:02.340
Yes.

01:40:03.049 --> 01:40:06.303
Good morning, Senpai.

01:41:15.038 --> 01:41:16.289
Sakura,

01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:20.961
is there anything Wu wanna
do after this battle is over?

01:41:23.922 --> 01:41:27.008
I can't really
think of anything.

01:41:27.259 --> 01:41:29.052
I think I'll be all right...

01:41:29.594 --> 01:41:31.805
if I could just be
together with you.

01:41:33.056 --> 01:41:36.810
Then, let's go out together
somewhere and play.

01:41:37.811 --> 01:41:39.312
Where would you like to go?

01:41:42.607 --> 01:41:48.655
I'd like to go to the
cherry-blossom viewing party.

01:41:51.157 --> 01:41:52.409
All right.

01:41:54.035 --> 01:41:55.245
That's a promise.

01:42:11.219 --> 01:42:15.265
Having a warm dream while
the heart is frozen...

01:42:17.225 --> 01:42:19.352
Someday, winter will pass,

01:42:19.894 --> 01:42:21.980
and when the new spring arrives,

01:42:23.106 --> 01:42:24.232
we will go...

01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:27.652
see the cherry
blossoms together.

01:42:47.464 --> 01:42:48.506
Right.

01:42:49.174 --> 01:42:50.633
When spring arrives...

01:42:53.595 --> 01:42:54.721
Senpai!

01:42:58.558 --> 01:43:01.144
I'm Sakura Matou.

01:43:01.519 --> 01:43:02.937
This is the second time...

01:43:03.271 --> 01:43:05.191
I've received something
important from someone...

01:43:06.274 --> 01:43:11.321
I wanted to protect my time together
with you going forward, as well.

01:43:13.948 --> 01:43:15.909
Senpai...

01:44:05.959 --> 01:44:07.293
Are you going to betray?

01:44:12.465 --> 01:44:13.550
Yeah.

01:44:14.467 --> 01:44:15.969
I'm going to betray.

01:44:47.792 --> 01:44:50.837
Thank you so much, Senpai.

01:44:51.212 --> 01:44:53.465
You've given me so many things.

01:44:55.216 --> 01:44:57.343
Thank you, Big Sister.

01:44:58.261 --> 01:45:02.015
I was really happy that I
could call you "Big Sister"!

01:45:02.765 --> 01:45:06.936
Miss Fujimura,
thank you very much.

01:45:09.731 --> 01:45:13.651
I'm sorry I couldn't
keep my promise to you.

01:45:19.491 --> 01:45:20.700
Rider,

01:45:21.242 --> 01:45:24.829
thank you for not
killing Senpai.

01:45:28.875 --> 01:45:30.084
Sakura...

01:45:35.215 --> 01:45:37.217
This is the final Command Spell!

01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:41.638
Please, Rider.

01:45:48.811 --> 01:45:51.773
I will stop Grandfather.

01:45:52.815 --> 01:45:54.817
It's already too late,

01:45:55.735 --> 01:45:58.905
but I can't cause any more
trouble than I already have.

01:46:02.367 --> 01:46:04.285
Sakura, good morning.

01:46:29.852 --> 01:46:32.438
Hey, traitor.

01:46:33.356 --> 01:46:36.526
You came home pretty
late, didn't you?

01:46:42.323 --> 01:46:43.700
U-Um...

01:46:44.075 --> 01:46:46.619
Big Brother, I...

01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:49.455
Hold this thing for a sec.

01:46:53.918 --> 01:46:55.628
It's nothing dangerous.

01:47:05.888 --> 01:47:07.390
So beautiful.

01:47:13.438 --> 01:47:15.148
You're amazing, Sakura.

01:47:19.986 --> 01:47:24.657
Maybe you'll surpass even
Tohsaka someday, huh'?

01:47:28.411 --> 01:47:31.414
Big Brother?

01:47:41.007 --> 01:47:43.217
Don't get cocky.

01:47:44.218 --> 01:47:47.013
After all,
you're nothing but my puppet.

01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:53.394
I made another mistake.

01:47:54.812 --> 01:47:57.440
That's why he's going to
do cruel things to me.

01:47:59.067 --> 01:48:00.693
It's fine.

01:48:01.027 --> 01:48:04.864
I just have to put up with
it for a while like usual.

01:48:06.074 --> 01:48:10.870
Put up with it, put up with it,
put up with it, put up with it...

01:48:11.371 --> 01:48:12.538
Sakura...

01:48:13.915 --> 01:48:14.999
No!

01:48:18.795 --> 01:48:19.879
I don't want to!

01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:23.257
I belong to Senpai now!

01:48:24.801 --> 01:48:26.344
What's this?

01:48:27.011 --> 01:48:29.722
He's tamed you quite a
bit, hasn't he?

01:48:30.932 --> 01:48:32.266
No!

01:48:32.850 --> 01:48:38.398
Hey! Why don't you
scream like usual, huh?

01:48:38.648 --> 01:48:39.439
Hey!

01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:41.526
I've been thinking
for such a long time.

01:48:42.235 --> 01:48:44.862
I've harbored hatred
for such a long time.

01:48:46.823 --> 01:48:49.492
Why does the world around me...

01:48:50.785 --> 01:48:52.036
hate me...

01:48:52.537 --> 01:48:54.747
this much?

01:48:59.377 --> 01:49:02.088
I'll have to tell
Emiya about all this.

01:49:02.588 --> 01:49:07.301
About how much you begged me...

01:49:08.469 --> 01:49:13.558
and how obscene our
intercourses have been!

01:49:17.437 --> 01:49:21.274
I wish someone like
this didn't exist.

01:49:43.713 --> 01:49:46.966
Big Brother...

01:50:45.608 --> 01:50:47.360
Sakura!

01:55:50.871 --> 01:55:57.044
NEXT CHAPTER PREVIEW

01:55:59.255 --> 01:56:00.297
So,

01:56:01.757 --> 01:56:03.509
grit your teeth!

01:56:38.377 --> 01:56:45.718
FINAL CHAPTER

01:56:47.011 --> 01:56:53.058
