00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.990
Solitude in white darkness.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.750
Prayer echoing across a cramped room.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.900
What am I going to do?

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.330
This is bad.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.860
Ithea?

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.600
Aye aye.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.350
I'm Ithea Myse Valgulious!

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.260
And...

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.640
Who are you?

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.290
WorldEnd:
What do you do at the end of the world?
Are you busy?
Will you save us?

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.800
Wh-Who am I? What are you...

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.950
Spell it out for me.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.040
Chtholly Nota Seniorious.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.480
Guess I didn't need to worry!

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.670
You're still Chtholly, all right.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.990
Worry... What are you talking about?

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.750
Why would you worry?

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.310
You have to ignore those nonsensical visions,
words, and memories of a past life.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.300
Otherwise, they'll eat away at you,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.810
and you'll lose your memories
and your sense of self.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.050
So these really are memories?

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.780
A red-haired girl keeps talking—

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.120
Don't think about her anymore!

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.520
She doesn't matter.
She has nothing to do with you.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.120
She's a total stranger,
of no relation to you.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.510
Think about yourself, as much as you can.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.540
Cling to your memories so they aren't
swept away by someone else's!

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.760
No generating venenum, either.
What were you thinking back there?

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.760
B-But I had to—

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.730
Ow.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.490
No "buts"!

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.440
You may have come back once,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.610
but who knows what might
happen next time?

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.610
Avoid anything that might trigger
a memory of a past life.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.200
Don't generate venenum.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.320
If you wanna stick around
as long as possible,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.270
you'll follow these two rules!

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.580
My disintegration hasn't really stopped, huh?

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.510
Even so, you decided to live on, right?

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.090
Mind if I tell you an old story?

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.400
It's about a girl I know very well.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.020
Just like you, her past life
ate away at her,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.140
and her entire persona vanished.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.760
Meanwhile, the girl who woke in
her place was also at a loss.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.380
She thought she'd died,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.080
but now she found herself
in an unfamiliar place and body!

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.790
Who am I?

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.730
Fortunately, she found a diary.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.040
The girl who'd disappeared had
updated it every day without fail.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.590
Are you...

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.250
A cheery busybody who kept sticking
her nose in other people's business

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.600
but never revealed her own true feelings.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.060
That's the kind of girl
Ithea Myse Valgulious was...

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.530
Back then, I even thought
about killing myself.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.170
But that would've been meaningless.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.060
The only way I could atone

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.500
was to take over as Ithea
without letting anyone find out.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.470
I've kept telling myself that and
somehow made it all the way to today.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.180
Oh...

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.040
I see.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.540
Maybe I should start a diary, too.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.820
Do you want someone to
take over your life?

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.450
How does the Chtholly here, right now,
want to live the life she has?

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.000
The Chtholly here, right now...

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.370
It's getting kinda chilly.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.910
I'm not as warm as Nephren,

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.420
but make do.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.690
Thank you. You're actually pretty warm.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.690
Glad to hear it.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.280
Chtholly...

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.920
Are you gonna keep this from the TO?

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.280
Yeah. It'd only worry him more.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.280
I won't beg for sympathy
like some tragic heroine.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.350
Oh, I see.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.960
Right now, I just want to savor the joy
of being by his side like usual.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.620
There's that whole "look at me,
I'm in love" shtick.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.600
You're definitely still Chtholly!

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.570
Jeez...

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.060
You're the first.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.780
The first person I've ever told
about Ithea and her diary.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.510
It can be our little secret, then.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.520
Aren't you going to ask?

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.750
Don't you want to know my real name
or the kind of person I was?

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.570
You're Ithea, too.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.340
A cheery busybody who keeps sticking
her nose in other people's business

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.830
but never reveals her own true feelings.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.610
Our fellow fairy and our precious friend.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.580
Nobody else.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.350
I really am grateful to hear it.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.250
All right!

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.380
Oh? It was you, Chtholly?

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.440
Oh, sorry.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.340
Was I too loud?

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.680
Your hair...

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.060
Not bad, right?

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.020
Yes, you're owning it!

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.340
Right?

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.200
I'm done moping about.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.730
Even the sadness that tears me apart

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.840
and the tears that are
always ready to flow

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.010
prove that I'm still here.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.470
All the worries,

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.440
frustration,

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:48.920
Hey!

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.310
sorrow,

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.990
and joy...

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:58.660
They're all parts that make up
the person standing here right now,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.960
who is, without a doubt, me.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.020
Chtholly.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.440
Yes, at least for now.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.490
Knitting?

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.590
It's gotten quite cold lately.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.220
And the little ones aren't
dressed warmly enough.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:30.790
Is that so?

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.900
Yeah.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.140
Well? Don't you think
this color suits me, too?

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.790
What's wrong?

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.610
Don't worry.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:58.440
Okay.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.070
If you say so.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.980
Thanks, Ren.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.150
How's Collon's cold?
Is she gonna be okay?

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.600
Still not over the hump, I'd say.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.900
I'll go get some medicine later.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.880
Okay.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.620
My, this is great! You've improved!

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.830
Chtholly...

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.580
When you get the chance,
put this under Collon's pillow.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.170
It's an ancient talisman to prevent
nightmares when you have a cold.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.140
What? Didn't you hear me?

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.980
Her cold has lasted a while now.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.520
O-Oh, right... Collon.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.220
Got it.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.580
Wow, I didn't know
you had something so handy.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.150
It's a part of Seniorious.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.230
Seniorious?

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.610
Didn't I tell you that dug weapons are
comprised of several different talismans?

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.400
The others prevent cuts when
the blade isn't imbued with magic,

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.820
or raise an alarm when
the wielder uses an alias...

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.070
Kinda useless, so we can ignore—

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.660
Put it back, right this instant!

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.440
What is wrong with you?!

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.120
Dug weapons aren't just
everyday charms!

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.500
They are ultimate weapons!

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.180
Get your priorities straight!

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.010
Oh, don't be silly...

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:47.930
Collon's getting a good night's sleep
obviously takes priority.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.750
What will I do with you?

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.030
Oh, whatever.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:57.130
I'm worried about her, too.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.030
Just put it back before
you go to the surface.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:01.380
Sure.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.850
Speaking of the surface, are they okay?

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.570
Nopht and Rhantolk, was it?

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.040
No need to worry for now, it seems.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:16.250
For what it's worth, the military is
rushing to finish the ship's remodeling.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.390
That's good to hear.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.440
I'm worried about that artifact
they recovered, too.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.740
What was it called, Lapidemsibilus?

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.850
You worry too much about me.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.520
Talk about an overprotective father...

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.600
Shut it.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.440
Well, better that than "sugar daddy."

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.730
Oh, come on... Not you, too.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.570
S-Stop it. What are you even saying?

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.030
Hup.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.780
Huh...

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.500
What?

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.980
You've gotten much better
at these things lately.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.820
It gives you a more traditional, girly charm—

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:02.050
I-I have to count the stitches,
so don't distract me!

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.850
What? I'm complimenting you.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.510
Let me focus, jeez!

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:16.940
You're still up, Rhan?

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:17.480
Yes.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.960
Man, how long is the rescue squad gonna take?

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.770
I heard we got word that
it'll take them a bit longer to prepare.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.920
You're reading that again?

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.720
Yes.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.590
Figure anything out?

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:32.290
No.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:37.030
But I think I can come up with an
alternate interpretation for this.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.060
"Humans by the surface..."

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:41.790
No.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.670
"By the humans, the surface..."

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.980
"The surface's..."?

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.140
Nopht, get off me.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.600
It's open.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.860
Staying up late again?

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.600
Yeah, kinda.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.710
Huh...

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.870
Uh, say...

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.270
You know those things you do?

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.070
Could you teach me to do them, too?

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.260
Like how to tune swords.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.130
And that thing you did for me.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.370
You know, the deal...

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.680
Wh-What's with the look?

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.150
What's gotten into you, really?

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.140
Lately, you haven't given me much
attention because you've been busy.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.730
But the time I spend learning
will count as time with you.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.550
Oh, come on...

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.350
Although I can't fight, I'm forcing you
to take me to the surface.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.010
I want to be of use.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.510
Neither of those is a skill
you can master overnight.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.390
You need to put in lots
of time and effort.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.720
Don't get too worked up.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.550
Despite how you feel,
I won't make you push yourself.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.840
I wouldn't be pushing myself.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.630
Don't play dumb.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.360
You've been losing your memories, right?

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.710
You knew?

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.280
It was obvious from watching you.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:18.930
So you were watching me.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.410
But if we have Lapidemsibilus,

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.520
we won't have to worry about that.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.200
A map of the surface?

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.490
Yeah. It's the area near the ruins,
where the survey team was attacked.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.520
Isn't this where the rescue squad
is supposed to land?

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.450
It's a bit close to camp, isn't it?

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:41.690
Oh, but I guess that makes it
easier to transfer the haul.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.960
What do we have here?
Aren't you quick on the uptake.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.820
I am your secretary, after all!

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.490
That's your home, right?

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.590
It used to be, 500 years ago.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.810
Do you want to go back?

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.260
This place is our home now.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:01.930
That's right.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.770
Say, what was your city like?

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.000
Did it have good food?
Anyone you were in love with?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.200
What's all this? Why the sudden interrogation?

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.150
One needs detailed intel on
their destination beforehand, right?

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:18.540
Give me a minute.
Let me get some tea for myself.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.730
Give me a break... You're just curious.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:25.960
This is great.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.270
Rather than worry and stand still,

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.320
I'll keep walking, one step at a time.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.600
My footsteps may fade behind me,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.820
and the path ahead may be dark.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.310
But I won't regret the past

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.650
or be pessimistic about the future.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.020
I shall simply live in the moment.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.120
Because no matter how I fight it,

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.640
the clock keeps ticking down on me.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.700
Eleven, twelve,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.700
thirteen, fourteen...

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.930
All right!

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:09.290
Auntie Ny!

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.150
And time keeps passing me by.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.470
I'm glad I finished in time.

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:24.700
Ah, this is for... Tiat.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.940
R-Right!

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.650
Thank you so much!
I'll treasure it forever!

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.860
This one is for... Lakhesh!

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.460
Um, thank you very much!

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.820
Hey, what about me?

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.550
What about me?

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.330
Wait your turn, Collon.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.910
Here you go, Collon.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.800
Whoa, so warm!

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.560
The rest of you hurry and
get over here, too.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:53.660
Chtholly's giving out presents!

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.960
What's with this party?

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.680
It's a snowfall fest.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.590
On snowy nights, when you can't go out,

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:03.000
you wine and dine all night long.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.130
Huh...

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.250
It's a popular event now,

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.390
but originally, it was a troll festival.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:10.400
Uh...

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.360
I think I'll pass on the details...

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.540
Well, let's say it's also a
send-off for all of you.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.240
It's not that big a deal.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.440
We have presents for
the older fairies, too.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.210
Though they aren't exactly from us...

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.290
Gosh!

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.200
You look so lovely, I could
eat you up right now!

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.830
I-I can't breathe!

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.600
And you'll wrinkle my dress!

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.240
That's a high-class lady for you!

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.760
I tip my hat to Lady Phyr's taste.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.520
Why would she send us all this?

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:47.520
For the snowfall fest, apparently.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.360
Er, "Thank you for all
your help back then.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.840
They aren't much, but I sent some
gifts for the snowfall fest.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.570
I hope you all visit
Corna di Luce again."

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:00.280
What is it, Ren?

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.540
You get this.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.220
Don't worry about it.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.460
Why, that little...

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.540
Wow!

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:15.780
Get going...

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.570
This is the time to compliment her, TO.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.970
Uh, but...

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.680
Say everything you want.
Ask about everything you want.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.890
You know better than anyone that
putting it off can be a bad idea, right?

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.240
So cool!

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.400
Hey, Chtholly...

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.040
You look beautiful.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.750
Do...

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.040
Don't I?

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.170
This should be enough clothing.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.840
What about books?

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.440
Chtholly, it's almost time to leave.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.560
Oh, okay.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.710
Who am I?

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.230
Later.

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.570
We're off.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.060
Slowly but surely,
my memories are fading away.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.510
The person I am is crumbling away.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.630
You girls be good, you hear?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.170
We'll prepare a "welcome back"
party for you as we wait.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.560
Don't push yourself.
It's a promise, okay?

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.540
Of course.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:54.560
I'm sorry.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:56.900
The truth is...

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:02.120
I've forgotten more than half
of what I knew about you all.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.170
I can relearn names I've forgotten,

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:10.440
but the memories I've lost
won't ever return.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.160
As everything I am falls apart,

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.920
can I even be called Chtholly at this point?

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.300
I'm heartbroken, hurt, and just so sad.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:28.980
But right now, I want to hold all
these feelings close to my heart.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.560
Because the moment they disappear, too,

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.700
there will be nothing left of me.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.500
Ren!

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:21.080
I never expected you to be
part of the rescue squad!

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.400
Man, you're as tiny as ever!

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.970
Hey, since you're here,

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:31.090
that means the massive timere was taken out...

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.100
So Chtholly opened the Fairy Gate, right?

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:37.000
Well, uh...

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.840
You know, we never got along well.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.740
But now, I feel like I should
have talked to her more.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.020
Uh...

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.950
What? Let me grieve for Chtholly.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:52.910
Long time no see, Nopht.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:53.880
Gho—

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.760
Go where?

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.370
Ghost!

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.870
Hey, wait up!

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:01.150
Nopht!

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:02.020
Stay away from me!

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.170
Hear me out!

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:04.520
Talk about lively.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:10.600
Next Episode

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:10.600
my happiness

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.840
Next Episode:

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.740
my happiness.
