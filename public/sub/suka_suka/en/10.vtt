00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.900
Orlandry Merchant Guild, Warehouse #4
File Storage

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.990
What an ungodly mess.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.260
WorldEnd:
What do you do at the end of the world?
Are you busy? Will you save us?

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.590
Oh, jeez...

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.170
Didn't anyone consider
sorting this mess out?

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.680
Oh, Nephren?

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.500
It's late. What's up?

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.730
Ren.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.860
Just call me "Ren."

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.200
Thanks for the coffee, Ren.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.320
What are you doing here so late?

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.950
Looking for your sortie records.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.570
In this pile of junk?

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.920
Need help?

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.950
Would you?

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.480
Okay.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.880
Then, look for files on timeres.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.450
I need to know sortie frequency and timing,
strength differential between sides,

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.220
and overall losses. The more
I learn, the better.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.340
You're asking a lot, but roger.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.740
Great. Let's get this done by morning.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.780
If I were going to die in five days,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.150
would you be a little nicer to me?

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.950
What if I asked you to let me kiss you?

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.310
Hang on...

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.340
What the heck did I say?!

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.520
What have I done? What have I done?
What have I done?! What have I done?!

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.940
Chtholly, you doin' all right?

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.320
Oh, you are!

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.400
That's great.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.280
Usually after a battle, you seem
to be in a lot of pain.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.440
Now that you mention it...

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.620
My body does feel a lot better.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.830
Yeah, it's all about heart and spirit!

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.080
Oh, it's because of last night's...

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.270
D-Do you know where he is?

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.800
You mean Willem?

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.830
Well...

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.800
Sleeping with Nephren!

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.930
Fairy weapons, huh?

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.730
Morning, Chtholly.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.320
Good morning.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.670
What were you doing together all night?

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.940
Trying to find a way for you to avoid
opening the Fairy Gate and dying.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.450
Don't you understand?

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.920
We have to be the ones to fight because
it's the only way to take them out.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.880
Is that really true?

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.510
We don't have a choice!

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.520
And we don't need your pity!

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.160
You're feeling better now, I take it?

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.390
Wh-Why?

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.730
Tag along for some morning exercise.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.630
Chtholly...

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.360
Are you ready to die because you want
to secure a future for these kids?

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.200
What does it matter?

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.390
Let's see how good you are. Bring it.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.910
Huh?

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.280
We're the only ones who
can wield dug weapons.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.920
You can't...

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.420
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.880
Maybe I can wield it better than you.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.300
Oh, really?

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.890
I hope you don't regret those words!

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.560
I'll end this farce.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.720
What just happened?

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:45.990
Is that it?

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.530
I'll...

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.200
You'll?

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.660
I'll get you this time!

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.540
What did you do?

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.220
Listen... Carillons, or dug weapons,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.040
aren't powerful swords that gain potency
from the wielder's venenum output.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.510
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.730
They're swords that use the enemy's force
against them when it hits the blade.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.560
The stronger the opponent,
the more lethal they are.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.840
Say...

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.040
Don't you think there could be

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.490
a better way to fight than
what you've done so far?

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.990
A way that doesn't use your so-called
trump card of self-destruction?

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.580
What could you possibly
understand about us?

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.090
You fight without knowing the basics,

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.580
so you can only swing your
sword with brute force.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.340
You're the one that doesn't understand.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.830
What the heck?

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.420
What is with you?

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.380
You show up out of nowhere
and act like you know it all!

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.190
Do you seriously think this
fighting style is good enough?

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.670
I won't accept it!

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.610
I can't accept it!

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.820
I can't accept that everything
we've done has been a mistake!

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.080
Just listen to me!

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.470
Don't listen to him!

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.920
If you understand how dug
weapons are meant to work...

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.830
Don't say it!

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.160
And if you learn the proper way
to fight with Seniorious...

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.760
Don't find out!

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.930
You could come back alive.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.890
What in the world are you...

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.410
Your movements are sharp.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.520
I like your guts and instincts, too.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.780
And your venenum flow
is pretty special.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.700
I can breathe easy now.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.980
You're plenty strong.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.270
And you have the potential
to grow much stronger.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.160
So...

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:04.390
You'd better come back alive.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.140
What's happening?

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.180
Let me confirm.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.720
Three days from now,
when the clock strikes eight,

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.810
we are to dispatch three wielders of dug
weapons, along with their swords,

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.740
from Island 68's port.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.320
One of these will be the fairy who wields
Seniorious, and during this operation...

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.530
During this operation,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.060
she is to open the Fairy Gate.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.540
Confirmed.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.460
Why must one of our girls
be the only one to die?

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.460
They have yet to experience love
or any of life's other joys.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.480
What the hell? What is
wrong with this world?

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:07.690
Pardon us.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.590
Wh-What? At least knock...

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.010
It's an emergency.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.100
Willem's...

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.790
Willem's gonna die!

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.460
You managed to defeat me?

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.420
Your strength is impressive,
young human.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.400
But all those spells you used

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.140
will surely return to torment you as curses.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.650
I shall now enter slumber for a century.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.510
Unfortunately, I don't think I
shall be able to see you die.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.320
Get going already, you zombie.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.640
Let me die in peace.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.780
Goodbye, human brave.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:13.100
I always knew I wouldn't
die a peaceful death.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.720
My bad, Lillia.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.860
Forgive me, Souwong.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.720
I must leave the rest to you.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.220
Almaria...

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.230
I'm truly sorry.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:42.780
A dream?

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.540
You seemed to be having
a pretty bad one.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.890
What's with your body?
Your bones are all broken,

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.310
your organs are barely functional,

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.840
and your muscles are so frail,
I could easily bite them off.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.560
Wouldn't be very filling, right?

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.550
I'm seriously worried!

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.830
I don't know what happened,

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.100
but how can you live in this state?

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.480
They're what you'd call battle scars.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.200
From the past?

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.760
Well, I went through a lot.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.360
Get some rest.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.990
No getting out of bed.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.690
It happened quite a while ago.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:35.790
I was helping a certain
group of salvagers.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.030
While exploring one day,

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.010
we came across a frozen
underground lake.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.040
That's where we found him.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:54.090
Our investigation revealed that he'd been
placed under a petrification curse.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:58.110
After that, we carried him
back to the sky islands.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.000
When he woke up, things got crazy.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.990
With him going wild and our
inability to communicate.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:13.210
But the babel talisman he had on him
helped us to talk to one another.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.460
That was how we finally
learned who he was.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.980
The human race turned other
races against it, kept fighting,

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.430
and was wiped out, along with
all surface life.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:30.140
That wretched race we call
emnetwihts had one sole survivor.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.720
That's him, Willem Kmetsch.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.730
I know how that makes you feel.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.280
But I don't want for you
to fear or hate him.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.280
So please...

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.220
Wait for me!

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.410
Willem!

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.800
What's this I hear about you
being wiped out?

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.630
Emnetwihts aren't really
very different from us.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:59.360
How intriguing.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.120
Tell me all about your people.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.420
Uh, I don't know how to say this,

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.160
but cheer up!

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.300
Sure.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:10.760
You girls...

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.610
Wait for me!

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:22.410
What am I going to do with them?

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.650
It sure got quieter all of a sudden.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.000
If you don't keep it down,
I'll throw you out, as well.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:30.990
Please don't.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.870
Since the half-dead man over there
is apparently an emnetwiht,

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.980
there's something I'd like to ask him.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.000
What is it?

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:42.460
I'm just wondering why a great
emnetwiht would go so far for us.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.420
I mean, risking your life
for no real reason?

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.890
That's pretty disgusting.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.460
Well, you know...

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.220
Isn't it only natural to be
nice to cute kids?

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.800
Especially if they're girls.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.880
We're only cute in appearance.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.560
Besides, we're all girls.
Gender isn't a consideration.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.570
An attractive appearance

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.880
is a manifestation of one's
desire to be loved.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.130
That desire to be held dear
is why they look like that.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.080
And that applies to us, too?

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.240
I mean, as a race,
you're all born in this form.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.810
Convincing argument, right?

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:21.670
So you're saying our entire race
is all attention-seekers?

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.590
And if we take into account
your love for young girls...

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.750
Oh, it makes sense now!

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.900
Wait, you've got it wrong.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.140
What the heck? That's hilarious!

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.300
Chtholly?

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.230
You must be kidding me.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.720
You can't be saying he's right.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.620
You're the one that doesn't understand.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.120
Do you seriously think this
fighting style is good enough?

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:00.940
There we go.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.500
I'm off, then.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.740
I was so, so scared.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.730
It took me so long to finally
resign myself to my fate.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.750
I don't want to go back.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.720
I'm sorry I showed up without notice.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.280
No problem.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.180
Proud warriors always have a place
to seek refuge from the winds.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.560
Thank you, Officer Limeskin.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:12.470
That's bitter...

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.580
What happened?

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:24.210
It's too late to say I'm
afraid of dying, isn't it?

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:31.340
Technical Officer Willem showed me
a new, different fighting style.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:33.550
I can't...

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.000
I can't accept it!

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.320
It'd mean accepting that the
older fairies died in vain!

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:40.890
But...

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.100
It struck fear within you?

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.440
Yes.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.010
I see!

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:54.030
That man wants to fight the
wind blowing inside of you?

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.360
Wind?

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.550
What you call resolve.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.940
Would it be a bit easier to understand
if I call it "resignation"?

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.830
Are you saying I lack
a warrior's resolve?

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.440
Nay.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.630
Resolve and resignation are
essentially the same thing.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:15.750
They both indicate a choice to cast aside
precious things to achieve one's goals.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.650
All warriors have wind in their hearts.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:23.880
On their aimless path,
it shows them the way.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.400
So once the battle ends,
their pure souls may find rest.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.190
Officer...

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.330
I don't understand half
of what you're saying.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.640
Is that so?

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.410
But I'd like to make a confession,
even if it gets me yelled at.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.610
Actually,

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.120
I have never wanted to be a warrior.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.180
Good job hanging in there, Seniorious.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:08.170
Hey.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.130
Welcome home, runaway girl.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.610
I was just out for a walk.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.280
What are you doing?

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.360
Maintenance on your partner.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.740
Don't do as you please without
the wielder's permission.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.530
What a beautiful performance.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.300
Performance, huh?

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.500
Say, what are these lights?

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.530
Shining talismans.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:50.950
Carillons are made

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.660
by fitting a bunch of talismans together
in the shape of a sword.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.820
Huh...

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.740
So this must be light from
a wish someone made.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.450
The talisman you just flicked

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.920
lets you avoid burning your
tongue on a hot drink.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.130
The one next to it

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.890
lets you know which way is north,
even in a place you've never been.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.410
And the ones above it prevent
nightmares when you have a cold,

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.590
Uh, this is Seniorious, right?

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.590
help you imitate cat meows...

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.180
Isn't it a legendary weapon?

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.320
Magically connecting talismans

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.120
causes a complex reaction and gives
them entirely new effects, apparently.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.990
Since it's called a legendary holy sword,

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.940
I thought it'd be something
more extraordinary.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.500
Too bad about that, huh?

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.370
I just spoke with First-Grade
Officer Limeskin.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.410
He said that if I make up
my mind by the day of the battle,

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.130
I don't have to open the Fairy Gate.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:57.420
And that he'd stake Island 15's fate
on my resolve and potential.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:19:59.760
Yeah?

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.100
Can I really grow stronger?

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.970
I'll make you, even if you don't want to.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.680
Let me take you up on that
and say this, then.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.720
What?

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.230
You see...

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.440
I don't want to be strong!

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.140
That's where you're supposed to notice
my affection and accept it in tears!

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.830
I'm being as accepting as I can.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.500
Take a hint, dummy.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.160
Then, if you come back alive,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.960
I'll grant you a wish, anything you want.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:42.650
Oh, but no "marry me" or
anything like that, okay?

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.060
But you said anything!

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.930
Pick something more
grounded in reality.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:52.920
Sweets...

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.600
The other day, you made sweets
in the mess, remember?

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.440
Can you make butter cake, too?

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.820
I'll feed you enough cake
to give you heartburn.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.310
You see, one of the older fairies

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:15.130
would feast on butter cake every
time she came back from battle.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.880
But since it's no longer
on the mess hall menu,

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.550
I can't imitate her.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.860
So, please.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.230
Of all things...

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.650
Willem?

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:29.850
Oh, fine.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.150
You're on. I'll feed you enough
to give you heartburn.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.250
So come back alive, no matter what.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.340
You got it.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.340
And?

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.040
Why are you grabbing
lunch with me here?

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.500
I taught them all I know

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.000
and tuned their swords
as much as I could.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.050
Uh, go see them off, dude!

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.560
Not like it'll improve their
chances of victory.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.640
You never know. A heart full of faith could
give birth to a mysterious power!

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.690
It won't. That's why everyone
has such a hard time.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.340
You're way too cynical, man.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.650
We're off, then.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.280
Oh, right...

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.950
Do you know any shops that sell
butter and flour for cheap?

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.920
Next Episode

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.920
dice in pot

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.520
Next Episode:

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.900
dice in pot.
