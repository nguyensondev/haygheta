00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.730
Marry me.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.320
I'll make you happy.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.670
What's with the smug look?

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.230
S-Smugging!

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.420
Smugging, really...

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.360
Did something good happen?

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.090
Huh?

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.930
W-Well, uh...

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.470
Gee, I wonder.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.150
You're like an open book.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.260
Say, Rhan...

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.940
What do you think
finding happiness is all about?

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.410
For starters, happiness means
different things to different people.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.330
To some, it means food on the table.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.020
To others, it means books on their shelf.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.400
Some say doing your best is all that matters.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.590
And some are only content
overcoming hurdles in their path.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.800
Some take happiness in the joy of others,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.320
and some, unfortunately,
revel in others' sorrow.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.080
I must say I wasn't expecting
a thesis in response.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.270
That said, most do not realize
these things about themselves.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.130
They do not know what brings them happiness.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.320
Still, they all keep talking about
their desire for happiness.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.460
One day, such people may learn
they were blessed all along,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.950
but they can never seize their own happiness.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.340
In the end, what matters is
listening to your heart's advice.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.660
Does that answer your question?

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.230
WorldEnd: What do you do at the end of the
world? Are you busy? Will you save us?

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.600
O-Oh, god...

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.070
I can't look Willem in the eye.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.090
How was I hitting on this guy
up until yesterday?

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.570
I don't remember it at all!

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.910
If I asked to kiss him again,

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.240
would he accept this time?

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.640
Yeah, it should work.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.210
I mean, he proposed to me.
We're practically a couple now.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.600
I'll give it a shot later.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.880
Yeah, sounds good. I'll do that!

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.690
Wh-What's with that reaction?

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.560
Quit blushing! You're making me blush!

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.860
Uh, listen...

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.230
Y-Yeah?

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.570
About yesterday's you-know-what...

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.710
Y-Yeah.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.750
I, uh, fully intend to keep my promise.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.250
I'll spend the rest of my
life making you happ—

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.120
There you two are!

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.040
This way!

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.050
Relax.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.150
I promised, didn't I?

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.750
I'll be with you forever!

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.340
Boss, where do you want me to put this?

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.810
Oh, just put it over there.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.500
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.030
What's this?

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.440
The forces of the visitor Elq Hrqstn.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.250
Elq?

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.740
According to legend,
this world was once home to gods.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.750
But they attacked the humans,
in a bid to wipe them out.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.750
The one at the top is Carminelake,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.750
the middle one is Jadenail,

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.300
and the last one is, uh...

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.870
Eboncandle.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.260
Yeah, that's it!

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.410
Of course you'd know.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.260
Well, I did fight him myself.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.260
Dude, you're trying way too hard.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.760
I should've asked them what happened
with the war after we took each other out.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.690
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.530
All right. Let me guide you
to your destination.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.150
Hey, it's Pops!

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.880
Sis! Pops is finally back!

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.030
I don't have the right to say,
"I'm home" now, do I?

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.040
Ship sailing the starry sky.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.530
Light in the palm of the hand.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.470
Clay doll walking on all fours.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.520
Something feels weird.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.240
Bottomless water bucket.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.690
Like something is calling me...

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.380
Underground?

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:37.620
What is it?

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.260
Something wrong, missy?

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.390
Wh-Wh-Wh-What is that?!

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.560
A m-monster!

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.020
That much is obvious, fool!

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.870
What I want to know is... Hold it!

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.240
D-Don't l-leave me... Th-This is scary—

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.320
Timere?

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.180
Ow...

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.580
Looks like we fell quite far...

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.530
A massive cave was beneath Gomag City?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.130
Why?

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.590
Chtholly?

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.280
Willem...

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.480
What's wrong with you?

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.150
You know your body can't take this!

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.450
No big deal...

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.540
Hey, you okay?

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.800
Yeah.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.800
We should probably get out of here at once.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.540
How?

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.950
This seems to be the underground ruins
where that moron sent a squad.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.300
Look at the markers.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.180
They should lead us to the exit.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.240
If the path hasn't caved in
somewhere, that is.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.260
Too bad. I could've just flown out before.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.530
No need to worry. I'll keep you safe.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.950
I'd rather be the one keeping you safe.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.080
Don't be like that.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.860
Guardians have the right,
and duty, to guard their charges.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.630
Who are you calling your charge?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.960
I'm now, uh, your...

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.130
wi...

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.620
Where's this stench coming from?

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.380
Is this it?

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.130
Is that the squad?

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.590
Yeah, this is awful.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.520
These messed-up wounds are
definitely a timere's work.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.060
If it's nearby, then we're in trouble...

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.730
Timere... One of the beasts
that destroyed the world.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.020
If they were really humans all along,

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.230
then the ones who did this...

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.740
Elq...

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.760
Yeah, okay.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.710
You want me to go there?

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.240
Got it.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.810
What's wrong, Chtholly?

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.710
I'll be right there.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:33.710
H-Hey...

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.460
Ch-Chtholly!

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.370
Missy!

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.550
Oh, come on!

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.010
What's going on?

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.440
Prepare to take off at once!

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.950
We can't! Shaft 3's been done in!

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.440
I'm a veteran first-grade technical officer.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.210
I can fix that in my sleep!

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.280
I'm telling you to be ready
to leave once I'm done!

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.480
Y-Yes, sir!

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.610
Hey! Welcome back!

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.400
Same to you. Where's Rhan?

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.240
Keeping watch over there.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.310
Can we call it a day now?
Haven't we taken out enough?

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.700
You really think we can?

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:10.330
I really do want this to end
before more people get hurt.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:16.380
I hope Chtholly, Grick, and that TO
get back in one piece.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.320
Yeah.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.720
Moron! Leave that crap behind!

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.870
But I went to all that trouble!

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.140
We don't have time for this!
Our lives are more important!

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.400
"Our lives are more important," huh?

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.650
Wise words.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.310
I don't really understand them, though.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.570
You must be tired, so get some rest.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:46.580
Guess I'll do my job and guard
everyone's lives and futures!

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.910
Chtholly!

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.670
Chtholly!

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.930
Hey, Chtholly!

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.470
Willem?

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.520
Yeah, it's me... Get a grip!

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.970
Don't lose sight of yourself!

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.240
Holy cow!

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:25.100
I never thought I'd see two of these
within a borgle's short lifespan...

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.970
Ouch! She's been stabbed clean through.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.120
Is that Seniorious's hex?

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:32.620
What?

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:36.540
You know how fairytales have curses
that can turn people into frogs and stuff?

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.520
This is similar.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.180
A curse that can turn anyone,
god or immortal, into a corpse.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.970
A world-altering ability
exclusive to the holy sword Seniorious.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.810
If it was used on her,

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.400
then she must've been no ordinary child.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.110
Chtholly?

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.050
Chtholly!

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.040
Crap!

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.280
Let's take the missy and bail!

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.830
Yeah.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.460
Chtholly, we're leaving.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.410
Try to stay in control of yourself.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.120
Chtholly...

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.480
I promise to save you.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.370
Willem...

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.550
Yeah, I'm right here.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.840
I'll always be here with you.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.980
Listen, I...

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:20.860
Chtholly?

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:22.800
What's wrong, Chtholly?

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.390
This way, Willem! Hurry up!

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.790
Chtholly? Hey, Chtholly...

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.930
Talk to me, please!

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.370
Gah!

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.940
Even the pressure valves are blown!

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.800
What? Is the ship done for, then?

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.190
I'm not about to die here!

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.450
Bring me every last thing
I could use to repair this!

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.810
I haven't brought happiness
to anyone in my entire life.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.880
That's why I wanted to make you girls...

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.340
I wanted to make you happy...

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.100
So why did things end up like this?

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.020
Missy...

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.020
I just want to be with them.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.940
I see... I'm sure that would
make them feel a lot better.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.030
I'm sorry. I couldn't do
more than bring her back.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.450
It wasn't anyone's fault.
No one was in the wrong.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.670
We were all just walking on very thin ice.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.880
Where am I?

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:51.850
For the one... I love.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:53.970
Love?

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.610
For that reason alone,
I'm here trying to slay a god.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.190
Even I know that it's stupid...

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.320
But I don't have a choice.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.930
I mean, he's the walking definition of stupid.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:15.160
So I have to act on these stupid ideas
before he has them.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.620
Because Willem's a complete and utter moron.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.180
Goodbye...

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.380
And rest in peace!

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.770
What was that?

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.570
Welcome back, Chtholly.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.620
I know you. I've met you before.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.100
There's something I wanna tell you!

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.370
What is it?

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.680
A long time ago,

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.520
a race called "humanity" was
trying to destroy the world.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.360
To prevent that,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.810
the poteaus, three gods who
were watching over the world,

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:15.180
led an army to wipe out humanity.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.930
But they failed.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:23.400
Because a human brave
killed their master first.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.650
No one could stop the humans now.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:30.950
They turned into beasts
and destroyed everything.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.120
What was the master's name?

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.170
Elq Hrqstn!

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.580
The last of the visitors,
who died as a child.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.400
And that's your name?

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.550
It's also the name of your soul.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:58.100
Fairies are made from the soul of a kid
who was too young to realize she was dead.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:03.870
Ever since Lillia killed me back then,
I've been dreaming.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.880
A dream of being like her,

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.900
putting my life on the line
and fighting for those I love.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.910
And that's what I am?

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:16.050
That's what all of you leprechauns are.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.410
What will happen to me?

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.000
You already know, don't you?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.640
No dream lasts forever.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.530
And it's quickly forgotten,

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.980
until nothing remains of it?

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:30.710
It's all right.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.380
You made it back here just in time.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.900
Rhan!

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.560
Thanks.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.160
Man, I'm beat...

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.320
Do you want to switch with Nephren?

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.740
Nah, she's kinda preoccupied.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:05.500
Besides, we've probably taken out
all the timere in the area by now.

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.440
By the way, Nopht...

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.340
How does your body feel?

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:13.520
Oh, super great, for some reason.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.340
And Desperatio's doing
exactly what I want, too!

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.180
Same here.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.350
In which case,

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.890
could these be the effects
of that dubious massage?

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.410
Ah...

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:31.530
So that man wasn't just touching us
all over for perverted reasons.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.210
Wow, mean...

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.360
You really hate him, huh?

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.850
I simply haven't accepted him as readily.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.910
Break time is over, it seems.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.060
Okay, okay.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:48.510
Given the shape I'm in today,
I could take another ten or twenty, easy!

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.820
How about a hundred or two?

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.000
That's a bit too much...

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.310
Is that so? Unfortunate.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.570
It appears we must prepare for the worst.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.740
Yeah, sure does.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.430
This sucks.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.820
In the end, I couldn't get around to it.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.290
Get around to what?

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:19.280
I wanted to talk to Chtholly more.
Even getting into a fight would've done.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.920
I got another chance, and I wasted it again.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.750
Indeed.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.610
All right...

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.890
Emergency repairs finished.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.130
Power up the circuits!

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.280
Roger that.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.120
Power up the circuits!

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.030
Take aim!

00:18:59.320 --> 00:18:59.990
Fire!

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.700
Captain!

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.590
Get back.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.340
We're the only ones who can kill beasts.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.460
B-But...

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.020
This is our battlefield.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:20.660
Here, "kill or be killed" applies to us alone.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.160
You...

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.160
You got hurt protecting us?

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.540
H-Hey!

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.660
Hurry up... Run.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:03.050
I won't be able to hold them off
for much longer.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.760
Three's too damaged to stay on the grid!

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:10.160
Two and six are fine!
Reroute the load to them!

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.320
Oh, for crying out loud!

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.340
I've only flown small ships!

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:28.270
Chtholly, I...

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.330
I really...

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:37.030
Maybe you didn't really
care about her at all.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.760
You couldn't stop Lillia from fighting.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:45.220
So you used her, another wielder
of Seniorious, as a substitute.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.640
You couldn't keep your promise to Almaria.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.360
So you made another promise with her instead.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.550
You never really saw her for who she was.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.520
And you kept treating her like a child

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.400
so you'd have an excuse
to not take her seriously.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.670
That isn't true! I wanted Chtholly to...

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.400
It is true! I wanted Al and the others to...

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.100
I'll make you happy.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:16.330
I failed to fulfill my promise again.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.600
Are you one of the so-called beasts?

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.750
Sucks to be you.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.110
Right now,

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:39.770
I'm extremely pissed off, and I
need someone to take it out on.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.990
There's hardly anything left of you now.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.190
You mind and body have been almost entirely

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.160
replaced by mine.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:57.340
I'm glad you made it here
before you disappeared completely.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.780
Your joys, your sorrows,
and your love for someone...

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.420
You still remember them a little, don't you?

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.290
Yeah.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.760
Only a little, though.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.220
It's all right, then. You're still you!

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.330
Wi... lle...

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.960
Final Episode

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.960
Chtholly

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.340
Final Episode:

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.960
Chtholly.
