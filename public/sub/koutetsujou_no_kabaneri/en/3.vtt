00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.150
"Corpseless"...?

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.450
Yes, something between a Corpse and a human.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.750
You're... the same as me, then?

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.750
Either way, it means you're not human!

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.800
If you're saying you're my enemy...

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.150
...I'll kill you.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.650
Corpses are the enemy of humanity.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.700
Stop, Kurusu!

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.850
If not for these two...

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.750
...we would all be dead.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.100
That does not mean we can have
the Corpses accompany us!

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.550
I feel the same way.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.450
I'm a Corpse.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.500
I will turn everyone here into Corpses.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.850
Wh-What are—?

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.700
You're a Corpseless, not a Corpse.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.350
Your body may be a Corpse,
but your mind's still human.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.650
You want me to believe—?!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.200
Ayame-san.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.900
This Iron Fortress goes to Daimond Citadel, doesn't it?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.950
Yes...

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.900
It does according to its schedule.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.900
"Daimond Citadel"?

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.300
You don't know?

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.500
It's the Warlord's greatest stronghold.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.100
Ayame-sama, if we are heading to Daimond Citadel—

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.100
Can you take me there?

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.400
If you do, we promise we'll stay in this car.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.700
Hey, I'm trying to talk—

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.100
Although I'm not leaving this train
whether you agree to it or not.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.950
Are you human or a Corpse?!

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.650
I'm neither!

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.700
I'm a Corpseless!

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.340
I will remember that day

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.760
Losing myself

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.100
In steam

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.490
Countless mistakes are made

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.780
When I can't see anything ahead

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.540
You said

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.080
"Ask your own burning blood"

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.960
Answer my beat

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.930
Stand up

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.310
And slam everything onto the ground

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.650
My soul is devoted to my friend

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.400
Burn your life

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.410
Change the world

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:31.150
Chapter
Three

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:31.150
Prayer
Offer

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.950
Suzuki-san, that's too dangerous!

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.150
I have to look at it from the side.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.950
I can't believe this.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.500
Don't just open the window!

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.750
It's one per person.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.400
We'll be back this evening with more food.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.550
Like this is going to be enough.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.000
Here you go.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.150
Thank you.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.650
And this is for your unborn baby.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.750
There isn't enough food and water for
the number of people that are onboard.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.450
Are we going to make it?

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.550
We still have to try.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.350
It's the last safe place we can go to.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.000
But what if Daimond Citadel doesn't take us in?

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.750
I have food rations.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.800
The current elder is Ayame-sama's uncle.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.700
We will not be turned away.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.350
Stop!

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.200
You have oil all over your hands!

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.600
It's my body!

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.550
A body mother gave you!

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.450
Your body's healed, hasn't it?

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.750
It's because your body is a Corpse's.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.650
You should be able to move around fine now.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.800
You said you were going to Daimond Citadel.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.600
I promised my brother.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.250
I can't tell you what, but I'm on an important mission.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.700
Are you interested in Daimond Citadel too?

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.500
They're at the forefront of Corpses research.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.100
They might be able to do something...
about this Corpseless condition.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.000
Didn't you want to get off?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.500
It's not that I fully believe...
your "Corpseless" story.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.150
But... if I'm trapped inside
this boiler car for three days...

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.250
...it will show that my mind will remain human.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.750
Then it's decided.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.650
Decided?

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.900
You'll ride the Iron Fortress with me.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.850
And you will be my shield.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.550
Shield?

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.950
When I fight for too long, I fall asleep.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.750
That's why I need a living shield.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.050
It's not like you have to worry about
getting bit by a Corpse, right?

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.050
Don't be ridi—

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.600
You're going to Daimond Citadel, right?

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.850
Then stand up.
We're going to start.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.650
Start what?

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.300
Training, obviously.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.000
You're not much of a shield right now!

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.750
Hold on!

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.000
Your motions are too big.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.500
Your feet are dragging.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.600
Wait!

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.350
How could you let the Corpse onto the train?

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.200
It's still not too late.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.900
We should throw the Corpses off!

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.450
They promised they would remain in the rear car.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.150
Like a Corpse knows how to keep a promise?!

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.000
Do the Six Chiefs not have
any sense of gratitude?

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.450
And that man has tried to do the right
thing even before becoming a Corpse.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.600
Y-You cannot just barge in here!

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.450
They demand we stop the Iron Fortress.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.600
They won't listen.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.100
Please stop the train.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.850
We want to hold a funeral.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.700
We want to pray for our family.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.550
Our prayers will not reach them if we go too far.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.750
Do you want our grandchildren unable to pass on?!

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.600
You're hopeless, how many times do I have to tell you?

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.900
You spin around and boom, boom, bam.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.600
You're not even close.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.100
Ju— Just because you can do it...

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.650
...your explanation is terrible!

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.700
Get it together already.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.300
You're already getting overpowered
when I haven't even removed my restraint.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.500
What is that thing around your neck for?

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.150
Probably the same as yours.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.700
It's just that if I remove mine,
I can fight at my full potential.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.650
But after a while, the curse spreads and I get tired.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.350
It's strange...

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.350
Corpse?

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.150
What is it?

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.800
H-Hey!

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.050
Nameless!

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.550
What are you doing?!

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.000
Please stop.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.150
I saw it!

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.000
You have got two!

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.350
It's the Corpse!

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:10.300
The Corpse!

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.700
She's not supposed to come out!

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.400
It's the Corpse!

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.750
The Corpse are loose!

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.850
If definitely felt it.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.800
Come back, Nameless!

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.600
You promised you were going
to stay in the boiler car.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.850
Stay out of my way!

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.450
Don't move!

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.400
So much for "Corpseless."

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.200
I knew not to trust you.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.050
Stop!

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.000
I'm taking Nameless back with me right now.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.850
I'll make sure she cooperates
until we reach Daimond Citadel!

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.400
You think you can make me?

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.060
Nameless-san!

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.900
What is the meaning of this?

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.700
Why did you come out?

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.300
You promised me...

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.350
You wouldn't understand even if I told you.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.150
Hey!

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.200
We never should have let Corpses onboard!

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.550
Let's remove them from the train now.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.250
I'd like to see you try.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.100
Stop it!

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.400
I've got bad news, Captain.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.250
Seems like the water tank we
patched together is busted.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.500
No way it's making it to the next station.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.200
Are we stopping?

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.750
They're gathering water.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.550
Check and see if the pressure's rising.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.800
Yes, that's it.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.850
There are no Corpses in sight.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.700
How long do we need in order to repair the water tank?

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.400
We might be done by morning.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:01.000
By morning...

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.450
We can have the lookouts rotate in shifts.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.100
Good idea.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.750
Then let us hold a vigil since
the Iron Fortress is stopped.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.200
For those elderly people?

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.800
I would like to pray as well.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.900
For my father.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:20.850
Understood.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.050
Please have mercy. Please have mercy.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.250
What?

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.550
Is that true?

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.350
Yeah.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.050
And pretending to be human.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.000
Unforgivable.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.250
Are you kidding me?

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.600
Hey, get back to work.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.850
It's not like praying is going
to bring them back to life.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.650
I'll do it.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.900
You are the worst.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.100
Did you lose someone too?

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.550
My teacher.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.950
Were you particularly close with your teacher?

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.400
Scumbag.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.850
That's just the kind of man I am.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.800
You're not going to pray?

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.450
I lost my family years ago.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:03.300
Oh.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.300
Just like me.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.100
It's a pretty common story.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.050
Losing your family to the Corpses.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.950
What's that in your right hand?

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.050
It hurts when I get hit by it.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.900
Just a rock you can find around any river.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.000
I found two of these pretty rocks with my sister.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.850
I told her she could have both...

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:42.260
...but she said we should both
keep one as good luck charms.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.050
I never planned on keeping it as a memento.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:51.450
Five years ago...

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.850
...the Corpses broke through our station.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.150
The adults fled in fear.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.550
We were left behind.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.850
And my sister was caught by the Corpse.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.800
It's a pretty common story, isn't it?

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.950
But what do you think her stupid brother did?

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.350
He ran away.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.250
I made an excuse about calling for help...

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.700
...and I ran from there.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.850
I tried to rely on someone else.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:31.950
By the time I returned...

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.600
...my sister was lying on the ground,
already beginning to change.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.200
The cowardly brother cried and apologized.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.300
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.850
But it was already too late.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.200
My sister was gone.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.800
Even if it meant dying with her...

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.900
...I should have overcome my fear and fought.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.650
No matter how much I hate
myself for running away...

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.200
...my sister is never coming back.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.350
Yeah, that's a pretty common story.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.600
The weak die...

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.200
...and the strong survive.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.250
That's all it is.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.850
Do we do it?

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.250
Let me do it.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.850
What are you planning on doing?

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.750
They are not our enemies.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.250
They saved us.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.050
The Corpses are our enemy!

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.950
What if they attack us first?

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.700
Please allow us to do this, Ayame-sama!

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.300
You people...

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:21.850
Ayame-sama?

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:24.600
Um...

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.050
Your friends are awful jumpy.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:28.750
That's...

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.400
Fine with me.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.550
If you want war, I am happy to oblige!

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:34.500
Hey!

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.600
Stop trying to act brave when you're weak.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.550
Nameless, don't provoke them!

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.350
They're the ones doing the provoking.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.800
Look! I knew the Corpseless were our enemy!

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.300
Don't back down!

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.200
We have to protect our families!

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.200
Purification!

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:55.900
Stop!

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.300
It's dangerous, please come down.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.200
Please don't, Ayame-sama.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.700
I can't?

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.500
I'm sorry.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.700
Mother... won't be able to have you.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.000
Shino-san?

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.500
It's the Corpseless!

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Why are you here?!

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.450
These guys are jumpy too.

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.250
I didn't come to fight.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.250
Hey, can you do me a favor?

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.400
Wh-What is it?

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.250
What's the matter?

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.650
Do you need to go potty?

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.150
Are you not feeling well?

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.350
He's laughing!

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:13.200
I got him to laugh!

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.800
Ikoma, you told my father...

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.050
...not to point our guns at the wrong targets.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.450
Then!

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.300
Are the Corpseless our enemy?

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.300
Or are you our allies?

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.500
A-Ayame-sama!

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.850
Please don't!

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.200
As the one left in charge of the Iron Fortress...

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.750
...I have to ascertain...

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.600
...who our enemies are, and who our allies are!

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:48.800
Why aren't you using your right arm?!

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.550
Why don't you just grab and bite me?!

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.600
I can't!

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.600
Why not?!

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.900
Because I made a vow!

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.350
I won't run away anymore.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.050
Even if it would save me.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.950
I am not sacrificing any more lives!

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.500
It's the Corpses who are our enemy.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:10.850
My purpose in life...

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.110
...is to destroy the Corpses!

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.450
Are you...

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.200
...satisfied now?

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.500
Those who still believe he is our enemy...

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.100
...you are welcome to come up here.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.950
I shall give you the opportunity
to check for yourself.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.200
I am sorry for testing you like that.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.250
It's okay.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.800
But why did you take the blade directly?

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.200
You could have grabbed my arm.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.950
No... um... my strength...

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:05.450
It hasn't been long since I became like this, so...

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.850
...I was afraid I might have hurt you.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.350
Oh, my.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.700
You do not need to be so concerned.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.650
Please worry more about yourself.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:15.350
Okay.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:26.500
Ikoma?

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.400
What happened?

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.000
Seriously! Stop!

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.450
That's so funny!

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.700
All that laughing made me hungry.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.650
We have some dumpling soup.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:48.650
I'll get you a bowl.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.350
Thanks.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.900
But I don't need that.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.150
Just give me blood.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.500
Blood?

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.250
It's red.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.150
The stuff that comes out when you cut someone.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.500
But you're...

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.500
A Corpseless.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.950
I'm half-Corpse, after all.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.550
It must be because of your bleeding.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.200
Please hold on.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.600
Are you kidding me?!

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.050
Are you telling us to become Corpse too?!

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.350
Get back, Kajika!

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.250
She's just a monster after all!

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.800
It's not my fault, I got hungry.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
It's a Corpse!

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.550
Shino-san?!

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:57.700
Wait!

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.650
She's...!

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.400
She's... pregnant...

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.150
Ikoma?!

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.550
You are...!

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:40.980
Even if the stars

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:46.530
That connect you make a sound

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:52.200
There are just dreams in the same rain

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:57.460
And lights are dried up

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:02.670
I am tired of getting answers

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:08.090
By mimicking others

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:13.510
Dawn without the sun

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.270
And broken morning

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:24.440
Smashed cry and dream
The ideal only has its doors

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:30.150
City is uplifted and drown in noise

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:35.540
I will still sing and stop turning the rudder

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:42.330
To hush silence
