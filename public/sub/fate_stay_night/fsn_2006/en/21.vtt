00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.930
Damn it!

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.810
What have I been fighting for?
What did I want to accompIish?

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.940
To bring the HoIy GraiI Wars
to an end...

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.810
Somewhere aIong the Iine,
that became secondary.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.810
Right. Ever since
that moment.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.750
I wish I didn't know about
what wouId happen.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.690
I wished that things wouId
stay the way they are.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.350
I didn't want
to Iose her.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.630
I'm in Iove with her.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.440
What's the matter, Saber? I went to aII
the troubIe of coming to see you.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.800
It's rude to stand there saying nothing,
don't you think?

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.620
It's hopeIess... Saber can't
beat this guy.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.980
Shirou, I wiII do whatever I must
to bIock his first strike.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.350
Use that time to--

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.080
Shirou!

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.490
Go! You're the one
who has to escape!

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.020
Here goes nothing! I'II try to
Project Saber's sword again...

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.190
Don't!

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.250
GIistening tears
turn into stars.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.590
Carried aIoft by the wind,
they adorn the sky.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.100
Even when the moonIight
is hidden behind the cIouds,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.900
...it stiII shines down
on me.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.100
Fed up with traveIing
straight down the raiIs,

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.720
...I reckIessIy broke out
into a run.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.220
My resignation turns
into determination,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.490
...and I find pride in
my worn-out heeIs.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:21.600
The path continues on,
going eastwards, going westwards.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.110
Even after the sun
goes down.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.210
GIistening tears
turn into stars.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.480
Carried aIoft by the wind,
they adorn the sky.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.050
Even when the moonIight
is hidden behind the cIouds,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.860
...it stiII shines down
on me.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.840
Episode 21 :
The Star of Creation
That Divided Heaven and Earth

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.110
I won't kiII you.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.820
If I kiIIed her Master now, it wouId
make it difficuIt to keep Saber aIive.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.390
But if you don't stop this
prattIing of yours, I'II--

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.720
Archer!

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.770
Judging from that Iook in your eye, you stiII
aren't interested in yieIding to me.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.470
Enough of your nonsense!

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.610
Your mana is as impressive
as ever, I see.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.250
That's the Iion I know!
That's the woman who has bewitched me!

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.780
Out of respect for that sword of yours,
I wiII show you aII of my own.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.130
Gate of BabyIon.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.170
Saber...

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.980
ImpossibIe!

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.830
Who in the worId
are you...?

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.370
You want to know
my true identity?

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.500
No singIe Epic Hero can possess
so many NobIe Phantasms...

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.270
I wouIdn't be
so hasty, Saber.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.640
Back in the farthest reaches of history,
back in the days when the worId was one,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.740
...didn't aII of the worId's treasures
beIong to a singIe king?

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.820
When the worId was one...
ImpossibIe!

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.550
Oh, but it is! My true name
is humanity's oIdest.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.790
The name of the Hero King of ancient Uruk!
GiIgamesh!

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.990
Hero King...

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.340
Resign yourseIf to
this fact, Saber.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.170
I am an Epic Hero that you two
are no match for.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.020
As to that...
We won't know untiI we try!

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.640
If you insist.
In that case...

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.920
...I wiII face you with
an appropriate weapon.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.890
With a sword that can onIy be
wieIded by a Hero King Iike me!

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.440
Don't do it, Saber...

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.100
Run!

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.040
Don't hoId back
on my account!

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.780
- ExcaIibur!
- Enuma EIish!

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.960
This is boring.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.540
Saber?

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.680
This is aII the so-caIIed greatest sword
in human history is capabIe of?

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.750
It couIdn't even hoId its own
against mine?

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.140
Oh, I get it! Maybe I shouId
have gone easy on her.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.050
After aII, I was fighting against
a woman and a chiId.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.490
Saber! Hey!
Hey!

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:52.530
Shirou...
Is that you?

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.640
Hey! Your eyes!
Wait right there!

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:07.280
Shirou... Oh, I see...
I was defeated, wasn't I?

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.720
PIease forgive me...

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:18.650
PIease, you must Ieave me
and run away...

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.460
Why do you have
to be Iike that?!

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.210
Trace, on!

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.010
Projection, eh?
Such paItry magic you use...

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.680
That's--

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:49.990
That sword in your hand, the ''sword in
the stone that chooses the king,''

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:54.320
...is descended from Scandinavia's ''sword
in the tree that bestows ruIership''.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.620
What I have here
is the origin of THAT.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.960
No matter how hard you try,
a repIica can't win against...

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.400
...the originaI.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.580
Shirou...

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.020
Shirou?

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.030
Shirou!

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.190
Shirou!

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.490
Stop this, Archer!
Your business is with me!

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.360
Oh, so are you saying that
you agree to be mine?

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.410
Give me your answer,
Saber!

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:41.900
I...

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:43.340
Don't answer him!

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.180
What do you think
you're doing?

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.620
It's no use!
Stop it!

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.420
I do not need your assistance,
and yet...

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.660
Why? Why don't
you understand?

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:05.760
No! If you were to die
over something Iike this, I--

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.360
Shut up!

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:13.740
Just shut up for a minute!
You can turn to me for heIp at times Iike this!

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.910
No, it's not that. You must hoId your Iife
more precious than mine...

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:23.610
There's nothing that I want
more than you, Saber!

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.680
Shirou...

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.120
There isn't anything in me that
couId ever take your pIace.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:36.700
I'm sorry. I Iove you more
than anything eIse, Saber.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.420
That's why I'm not gonna hand
you over to this guy!

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.900
You fooI. You aren't worthy
of this treasure.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.570
Get Iost, Hero King!

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.840
You haIf-breed...

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.180
It wiII take some effort to keep Saber aIive,
but I suppose I wiII crush you after aII.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.590
Trace, on...

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.160
VisuaIize it...

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.520
...visuaIize in your imagination
something that CAN defeat him.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.530
VisuaIize it...

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.100
What you shouId aIways be visuaIizing
is yourseIf at your most powerfuI.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.040
My most powerfuI...

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.900
VisuaIize it!

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.270
What's this?

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.500
Shirou! Use that!

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.040
Don't be a bad Ioser!

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.810
Shirou!

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:41.320
Saber...

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:45.950
I finaIIy figured it out...

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.360
AII this time, Shirou, you were
my scabbard, weren't you?

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.340
This is the end of your kingdom,
King Arthur!

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:44.480
Why? Why didn't you turn over
the throne to me?!

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:49.710
I had but one reason. You do not
have it within you to be king.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.170
Father...

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.740
Saber...

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.420
Saber!

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.060
That was a dream...
One of Saber's.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.560
I was cut by that guy,
and then--

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.730
It's heaIed!

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.000
Saber.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.410
Ah, I see that you
are awake, Shirou.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.770
Have I been asIeep
ever since--

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.410
Yes, you have been asIeep
untiI just this moment.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.850
Your body is aImost compIeteIy heaIed,
so you needn't worry.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.220
Oh. Um, good.
How about yours, Saber?

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.320
My injuries do not pose
any probIems for me.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.060
Oh, I see...
So, he's going to--

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.030
Yes, he is certain
to turn up again.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:45.440
It aImost seems Iike he deIiberateIy Iet us go.
Can we beat him?

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:46.930
It wiII be difficuIt.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.950
NevertheIess, if we are to acquire
the HoIy GraiI, we must defeat him!

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.290
So she can redo the seIection
of the king, huh?

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.960
If you are abIe to get up,
you shouId eat a IittIe.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.830
I shaII make
something for you.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.570
Um, Saber?

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.680
No, I insist!
AIIow me!

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.580
It's just that--

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.710
I have observed you and Rin
prepare food on many occasions.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:36.020
Saber...

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:42.260
Um... In that case, perhaps you couId
show me the proper technique?

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.600
So, if you turn the daikon
as you go, it'II...

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.370
Ah, I see!
How cIever!

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.490
Listen, Saber...

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.620
Yes?

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.630
Give up on trying to redo
the seIection of king.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.230
I had one of your
dreams earIier.

00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:28.740
You fought on by yourseIf to the bitter end
and kept your vow, right?

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.770
SureIy you've
done enough.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:36.680
If we get the HoIy GraiI, I want you to
stay here and find happiness for yourseIf.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.310
I want you to stay here
with me.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.070
Hey, wait a minute,
Saber!

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:56.430
There is nothing more
to discuss.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.710
Saber, I was just--

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.520
I'd rather that you didn't
make this difficuIt for me.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.650
Being treated Iike this
makes me uncomfortabIe.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.460
Push me away, then.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.420
This is unfair of you,
Shirou.

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:28.090
You know my past, and you have
been inside my mind many times.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:34.240
You must know fuII weII
what my answer wiII be.

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:39.070
You must know the grave sins
that I have committed!

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.370
I can't heIp it, I feII
in Iove with you.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.550
I can't Ieave you
Iike this.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:53.390
Though I was unworthy, the country
was entrusted to me as her king.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.690
And as someone who did not fuIfiII that duty,
I am not permitted such Iiberty.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.230
Saber!

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.110
Don't...

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.620
Shirou, I...

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:17.110
My mana is repIenished.
I can now fight at any time.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:22.020
As your Servant.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.760
Kotomine?

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.060
He isn't around?

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.770
I wanted to ask him
about GiIgamesh, but he--

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.110
Stay away...

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.070
That voice...

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.450
Go away! Go away!
Go away!

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:06.920
Stay away! No one is here!
Go home!

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.520
Don't stop waIking!
Don't go down there!

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.790
Kotomine isn't here.
There isn't anything here.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.440
No one is here!

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.700
There aren't any
dead bodies here.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.640
An underground chapeI?

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.760
This can't be happening!

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.420
It is good that you have come,
Emiya Shirou.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.520
You!

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.370
This may be a church,

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:53.130
...but I wouId advise against going
into the back without permission.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:23.560
In the deep, dark forest, as I search
for the faint fragrance...

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:35.980
...of the Iingering traces of the days
I heId dear, I suddenIy hear you Iaugh.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:48.790
I reach out to try to touch you, but your
image fIuttered fIeetingIy in midair.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:58.970
I've missed you for so Iong,
I've Ionged for you for so Iong.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:03.340
Wandering through
sIeepIess nights,

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:19.190
...I am crying, enveIoped within the
Iight and shadow you Ieft behind,

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:30.970
...here in the deep,
dark forest.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.290
Next Time

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:45.190
Next Time
Fate Stay Night...

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:46.050
Fate Stay Night...

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:05.370
Next time,
''The ResuIt of a Wish.''

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:07.880
Next Time:
The ResuIt of a Wish
Next time,
''The ResuIt of a Wish.''

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.340
Next Time:
The ResuIt of a Wish
