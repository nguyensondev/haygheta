00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.460
So that's it.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.760
That's it!

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.800
That was beautiful...

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.850
So mature!

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.380
Yes.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.060
I hope I'm in love someday, too.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.620
Couldn't get into it, huh?

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.700
Not with lizards, no.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.080
Are you worried about
Chtholly and the rest?

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.660
Half a month has passed without any word.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.710
I know I can't do anything but wait.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.140
At times like these, it might
be best to stay busy!

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.200
Mind doing some work for me?

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.100
Work?

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.690
H-H-H-Here's your order!

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.630
Wow, that looks so good...

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.220
Thank you, master.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.240
I-I'm sorry! Don't eat me!

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.040
Please don't eat me!

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.280
Did you do something to him?

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.030
Of course not!

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.250
WorldEnd:
What do you do at the end of the world?
Are you busy? Will you save us?

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.080
Man... We should probably
call in pros to fix this.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.380
Guess I'll patch it up for now.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.170
Hey, Chtholly. Get me the hammer.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.090
Chtholly?

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.560
Ithea?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.410
Ren?

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.400
Chtholly!

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.530
Ithea!

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.690
Ren!

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.900
Ch-Chtholly!

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.990
Chtholly!

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.320
Chtholly!

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.830
Just accept it.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.960
Have you forgotten that we
sent them off to battle?

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.130
Those girls are gone now.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.770
They are all

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.890
dead.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.820
Damn, I'm so glad it was a dream!

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.400
What? What's up?

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.600
Uh, look. We can see it now.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.070
See what?

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.060
Whoa! It's Corna di Luce!

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.780
Règles Aile, Island 11
City of Corna di Luce

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.540
"Just a hop, skip, and a
jump away," my ass.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.500
It took a whole day to get here...

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.960
Wow, seems even the disfeatured
can live normal lives in this city.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.670
It's such a beautiful place!

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.150
Tiat had a dream.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.240
Of somewhere she has never been,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.820
sights she has never seen,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.180
and speaking to someone
she has never met.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.070
That kind of dream.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.100
Drinking milk won't make
you taller immediately.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.580
W-We don't know that.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.500
Tiat has been doing her best
and drinking her milk every day.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.460
She might suddenly go zoom!

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.930
Isn't that how most dreams are?

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.520
No.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.800
Apparently, the girls can tell.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.170
The moment they wake up, they know
that the dream they had was special.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.890
And that is the harbinger.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.850
All fairies who have the harbinger dream

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.410
are to get a checkup at
Corna di Luce's general hospital.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.040
G'day.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.790
Whoa, no way!

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.630
It's the clock tower from The Iguana Bride,
that movie we watched!

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.460
Amazing!

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.260
Are there any sights you wanna see?

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.380
It's your first time out of Island 68, right?

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.120
I-I'm not here to have fun.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.260
I'm here to become a great
fairy soldier like Chtholly.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.230
There's no way I wanna... sightsee.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.150
That's what I thought.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.180
But we still have time.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.370
We could stop by some places
on the way to the hospital.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.250
Hmm...

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.760
Okay. Very well.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.800
If you want to sightsee that much,
I'll tag along.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.540
Right...

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.120
Let's get going, then!

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.470
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.850
Look! Look at this!

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.640
What about the bench?

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.510
In When the Bell Rings Thrice,

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.000
the heroine cries here, holding
her former lover's severed tail!

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.570
Is that another romance
movie with lizards?

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.430
You haven't heard of it?

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.940
It was a big deal. The heroine
laid her eggs during filming.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.280
Yeah, that does sound like a big deal.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.310
Island 11's Corna di Luce is also
the setting for loads of stories.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.500
It's a place overflowing with history,
a jewel in the sky,

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.880
and a stew pot of adventure and legend!

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.710
"Stew pot"? What?

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:34.350
The staircase where the couple in
The Airship Thief clawed at one another.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:39.680
I hear the lead actor's shed skin
fetched a fortune at auction.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.270
I wonder who bought it. Lucky them.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.310
You sure do love lizards.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.790
In Each Scale Is a Symbol of Love,

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:52.030
the heroine and the soldier, covered in
scales, smacked tails in this river!

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.440
While filming, the director served
food for everyone on set.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.800
A million steelbottle flies.
Can you believe that?

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.190
Did they really eat all that?

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.350
Ah, I see.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.170
I feel stuffed just thinking about it!

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.170
Isn't that great...

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:08.730
G'day.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.360
This is the café... where the two went
lickity... on the egg in Sweet Nest.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.230
P-People are actually doing it here.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.440
In the middle of the day...

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.510
I don't really understand,

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.420
but I do get the feeling
kids shouldn't see this.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.190
Say, Tiat, it's about time.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.530
What now?

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.990
The Great Sage statue in
Fulshter Memorial Plaza!

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.890
And why is it famous?

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.860
Long, long ago, he founded this city.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.620
It's the most popular spot
for lovers' rendezvous.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.740
It also appears in several stories!

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.530
Legend says that if a couple vows
their eternal love in front of it,

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.270
they'll be happy for five years.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.370
Talk about a half-assed legend.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.980
Annihilate!

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.520
Annihilate! Annihilate!

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.600
Annihilate!

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.820
Annihilate!

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:10.820
Annihilate!

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.650
Stop... Please stop.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.650
Annihilate! Annihilate!
Annihilate! Annihilate!

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.030
I beg you, please stop!

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.330
Annihilate! Annihilate! Annihilate!

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.360
Cease.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:18.740
Cease.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.320
Tch. Let's get outta here.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.120
Yeah.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.760
Outta my way!

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:30.240
Wh-Why, you—

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.300
Arrest.

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.630
D-Damn it all!

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.090
Are you okay?

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.910
Th-Thank you.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.370
Hey... Hey, put me down.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.220
I'm not a child!

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.220
Oh, my bad.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.450
The Annihilation Knights again?

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.470
That stall's owner supported
the mayor, remember?

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.600
What was that?

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.780
I guess there are always people with
too much energy on their hands.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.340
Oh? It's almost time.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.550
We don't want to be late.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.140
N-No.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.280
I know! The sightseeing ends here!

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.960
Let's go, Willem.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.190
It's obvious you're forcing
yourself, you know.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.220
Hurry up!

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.540
Yeah.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.010
Tiat and Willem Kmetsch, yes?

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.080
NyNy told me you were coming.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.570
NyNy?

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.480
Oh, you mean Nygglatho.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.830
Let's get the checkup started, then.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.780
This way, Tiat.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.570
R-Right.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.530
Tiat...

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:49.290
Well, our airship back home
is tomorrow evening...

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.350
Once we're done here,

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.360
I think we'll have time
for a leisurely stroll.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.090
Okay!

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.540
There you are.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.350
I've checked several kids from
the fairy warehouse before,

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:33.330
but you are the first caretaker other
than NyNy to accompany one.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.130
The checkup will be done soon.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.480
Tiat is a good, responsible girl.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.680
What is this checkup for?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.410
Didn't NyNy tell you?

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:45.880
Not in detail, no.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:54.680
Basically, it isn't like any fairy
can wield a dug weapon...

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:59.290
The ability is there, but it won't
awaken in all of them.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:05.150
And the fairies that have the harbinger
dream will awaken that ability?

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.810
Exactly.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:14.100
And we tune their bodies so that
they can fight as adult fairies.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.590
The dug weapons are too precious,
and the enemy too powerful.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.140
Forcing swords onto kids when they're
still immature would be pointless.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.860
"Tune," huh?

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:33.900
Her growth is steady and is
as expected of her age.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.410
And she has no major health issues.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.200
The only problems are

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.520
her digestive organs are struggling to
process the excess milk she drinks,

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.370
and a few of her teeth
are developing cavities.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.730
I'll tell her to tone it down.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.500
The fairies are unnatural beings.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:58.280
Sometimes, a problem may arise
and severely affect the body.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.630
In the worst case, they may
suffer mental disintegration

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.590
and lose their minds completely.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:12.220
But in Tiat's case, there is
no cause for concern.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.040
She is firmly in control of herself.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.020
She is in great shape.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.070
That's good to hear.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:22.890
Hey.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.300
Done with the checkup?

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.440
Yeah.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.740
I'll stay the night, and tuning
will be tomorrow morning.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.130
We'll be finished by noon, so come
pick her up around then.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.080
Got it.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.150
Will you be okay? Can you stay
overnight by yourself?

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.400
O-Of course! I'll be perfectly fine!

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.080
What about you?

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.790
Where will you stay tonight?

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.890
At Guardian Wings Military HQ.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.720
Evidently, they have a resting
room for officers like me.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.280
Officers like you?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.390
I'm actually pretty high
up the pecking order.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.940
Huh...

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.330
Well, I'll be all grown up tomorrow!

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:03.880
Just you wait!

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.000
It seems tuning won't
make you any taller.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.360
I... I wasn't hoping for that!

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.640
Hang in there.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.930
Goodbye, then.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.220
Take care of her.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.050
"All grown up," huh?

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.770
Do you realize what you're saying?

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.790
It means becoming a soldier
and going off to battle.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.020
This sucks.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.890
This way, Technical Officer Willem.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:54.080
Wow, technical officers really do
rank high in the pecking order.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.720
Please use this room while you're here.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.600
Goodnight.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.000
Oh, hey.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.790
Yes?

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:05.130
Have you heard any word about
the battle on Island 15 against the timere?

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.210
No, nothing.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.210
I see.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:11.120
Sorry to have kept you.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.180
Excuse me.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.980
I didn't get much sleep.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.190
The bed was so soft,
it was off-putting...

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.700
Guess I'll go for a walk.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:43.620
I have to go sightseeing with
Tiat this afternoon.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.780
Maybe an advance look—

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.140
Take a damn hint, Corna di Luce!

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:56.730
Okay, this is bad.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.770
We should patch it up for now.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.720
But how?

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.800
Did we have a ladder that tall?

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.270
You have a point.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.610
Well, only one choice!

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.570
We'll start by building a ladder.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.000
Are you all right?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.400
I'm fine. No problem.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.680
That so?

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.060
U-Um, wait a second!

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.220
What? We were both equally at fault.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:40.430
No, I was entirely to blame for that,
so I'll keep my blade sheathed.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.680
I see. I'm glad you understand...

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.880
Wait, blade?

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.230
I have a favor to ask.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.520
I need to make a request
of Officer Limeskin.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.610
Is there any way I could see him?

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.070
Limeskin?

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.940
That giant lizard is fighting
somewhere far away.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.820
When will he be back?

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.010
That's what I'd like to know.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.560
They've put up a magic field—

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.300
A barrier around the battlefield,
making communication impossible.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:12.730
Is it true?

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.970
Yeah, send word at once.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.080
Are we sure?

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.700
Apparently. In battle with the timere.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.340
W-Wait...

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.380
What happened?

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.190
I-It's classified.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:32.510
This information can only be circulated
on a regulated channel.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:36.240
I'm Second-Grade Technical
Officer Willem Kmetsch.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.530
Forgive me, sir.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.210
The dug weapons and fairy soldiers...

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.260
The ones that wield them
are under my care.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:48.760
Of course, I also have the right to all data
pertaining to battles they take part in!

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.630
Again, I ask that you provide
me with this information.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:54.630
What happened?

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.900
Sir, Fleet 1 just sent word

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.220
regarding the results of
the battle on Island 15.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.910
The defense of Island 15...

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.350
has failed.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.550
Excuse me, then.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.890
Um, what's wrong?

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.070
What's the matter? Are you all right?

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.040
Hello? Hello?

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:30.090
Hello, are you all right?
Can you hear me?

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.630
The other day, you made sweets
in the mess, remember?

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.800
Can you make butter cake, too?

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:49.480
Uh, does it hurt somewhere?

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.220
What? Really?

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.560
Do we have confirmation?

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.900
We just received it from
General Command HQ.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.690
How many casualties? Survivors?

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.350
Fleet 1 of the 2nd Division
has returned.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.880
We've received an accurate
casualty report!

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.370
Send medics, just in case!

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.920
I think we should send word
as soon as possible.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.980
Agreed.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.770
A certain someone's heart is probably
jumping out of his chest as he waits.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.210
But...

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.470
Given the circumstances,

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.220
I allow you to use the
communication crystals.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.620
See? We even got the
big boss's permission.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:38.740
But use of a communication crystal
lets the other person see us, too.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.820
And I'm covered in mud.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.040
I haven't even taken a bath.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.100
You'll be fine as you are.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:52.150
But it would be rude, and I'm
not mentally prepared...

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.190
You girls!

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.550
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Whahat?

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.760
H-H-Hey, it hurts... I can't breathe.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.280
Where the heck did he come from?

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.100
This is embarrassing!

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.400
I'm covered in dirt. I hurt all over.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.120
My eyes could not keep up with him.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.970
I haven't taken a bath...

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.570
Everyone's watching!

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.400
Did he use a lost secret art?

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.920
Hey, you're wet from the rain!

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.810
This is why I said we should
send word quickly.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.510
Brr!

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:49.920
You'll catch a cold, you know?

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:50.710
Yeah, you did.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.760
Wait, that isn't it...

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.280
But did you expect to find
the TO this broken?

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.170
Jeez, what's wrong with you?!

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.900
Let me go already!

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.900
Broken?

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.800
Are you listening to me?

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:58.980
Hey!

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:03.790
I mean, he usually tries
to play it cool, right?

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:08.070
The fact that it doesn't
suit him at all is cute, though.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.290
Anyway, I was expecting a
less emotional reunion.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.480
This is how Willem is.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.890
One-track mind. Dial turned to eleven.

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.880
You have to watch over him
so he doesn't get hurt.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.720
Yeah, I kinda get what you mean...

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.700
What do you think, Chtholly?

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:30.320
I think you should finish your
fun, little chat and help me!

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.860
I feel like we should let him
hug you until he's satisfied.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:35.920
No way!

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.190
My spine will break, I'll suffocate,
or I'll die of embarrassment first!

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.380
If you can yell like that,

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.780
I don't think we need to
worry about suffocation.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.950
Don't worry. We're all here.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:53.870
We aren't going anywhere.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.360
Ren...

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.070
Yep.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.420
Ithea.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.800
Heya.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.170
And...

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:08.520
Chtholly.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.760
Seriously, let me go already...
My heart can't take any more!

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:23.610
Things sure have gotten messy.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:24.280
Yes.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.920
Next Episode

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.920
from dawn till dusk

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:07.500
Next Episode:

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.870
from dawn till dusk.
