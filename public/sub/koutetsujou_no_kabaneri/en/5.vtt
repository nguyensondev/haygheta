00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.100
Fire!

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.200
That is impressive.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.990
I used their piercing guns as a
reference to invent these jet bullets.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.290
It explodes inside the cartridge,
blasting the metal plate.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.750
The plating melts, propelling the
bullet with tremendous force.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.930
In other words, even we will be able
to take down the Corpse with these.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.210
That's right.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.100
Oh, and didn't you mention that you
did something with a sword too?

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.850
Yes.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.300
I tried coating the blade with the
metallic layer around the Corpse's heart.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.000
This should make it more durable.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.950
That's mine!

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.720
I did your share of the work too!

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.610
So I'm taking this!

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.800
What? You've got to be kidding me.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.550
Give it to me! Give it to me!

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.700
Please stop!

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.750
I said, give it to me!

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.650
Hey.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.950
Could you do that outside?

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.900
Huh?!

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.600
You...

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.030
...stay out of it!

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.950
What'd you say?

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.750
Nameless-chan, you're scaring me!

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.150
Please stop!

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.660
Is that Nameless-chan?

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.000
What is she doing?

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.200
You're scaring the children!

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.590
Never do this again!

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.350
Got it?

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.100
Yes. We’re sorry.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.300
Hey.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.030
Are you causing trouble?

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.280
No!

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.950
I'm—

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.650
Make way.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.550
Oh, did you take care of this, Nameless-san?

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.040
Ayame-sama!

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.350
I came because I heard a commotion, but...

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.000
Thank you, Nameless-san.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.600
You are the Iron Fortress's bodyguard.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.900
Bodyguard?

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.400
Someone who protects everyone.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.100
A person people can rely on.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.650
That's right!

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.800
She's real strong!

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.700
If Nameless-chan is our bodyguard
we have nothing to worry about!

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.470
What is that?

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.600
That's stupid.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.800
Emergency brakes?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.950
What could have happened?

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.200
There's no answer from Yashiro Station!

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.550
Have they been overrun by Corpses?

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.600
Are you certain?

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.200
Signal fire confirmed!

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.400
There appears to be survivors!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.700
We will send a rescue team right away!

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.060
Are you human or a Corpse?!

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.760
I'm neither!

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.710
I'm a Corpseless!

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.650
I will remember that day

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.650
Losing myself

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.950
In steam

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.800
Countless mistakes are made

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.200
When I can't see anything ahead

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.000
You said

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.500
"Ask your own burning blood"

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.750
Answer my beat

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.300
Corpseless of the Iron Fortress

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.250
Stand up

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.750
And slam everything onto the ground

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.000
My soul is devoted to my friend

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.700
Burn your life

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.750
Change the world

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.350
Chapter
Five

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.350
Inescapable
Darkness

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.350
This point here.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.350
A watchtower has fallen over the rails
and is blocking us from passing.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.550
What if we turn back and go through Ishikori
Station from Nagi Mountain Pass instead?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.100
That will take 10 days to reach.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.300
Our food rations would not last.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.300
Yes, we were supposed to
resupply here at this station.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.040
They’re survivors from Yashiro Station.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.700
Please give them some food and water.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.000
Did the Corpses get you?

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.120
A black smoke...

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.850
...suddenly engulfed us.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.070
It was three days ago.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.750
It came over the walls.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.450
The rest was hell.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.150
What?

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.400
You guys are such cowards.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.700
I'm sorry, would it be okay
if I went to the bathroom?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
It’s over there.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.670
You scared?

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.730
Nope.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.100
Not at all.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.000
I'll wait for you outside.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:53.850
It has been a long time.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.300
I never imagined I'd see you here.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.050
Yes, it has been a long time.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.700
How you been?

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.350
I can still help the Young Master
without being on the frontlines.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.950
Did you need something from me?

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.300
Twenty days ago...

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.140
...the Headquarters were stocking
themselves up with weapons.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.000
And not for the Corpses.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.950
They're weapons to kill people.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.050
Tell the Young Master that
they're acting suspiciously.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.300
Also mention that I, Enoku,
will come to his aid in his time of need.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.200
I don't think that's going to be enough
for him to welcome you back.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.800
Bye.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.050
What?

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.050
I didn't hear you answer.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.650
You're no longer my brother's ear.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.400
Try this again, and I'll will you.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.300
Who is about to get killed here?

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.950
You've gotten slow, Nameless.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.000
You shouldn't be wasting time
playing nice with the people.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.220
You are the Young Master's Claw.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.250
You only have value when
you’re tearing the Corpses apart.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.350
Falter, and he will abandon you too.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.300
Help!

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.150
Fulfill your mission, Nameless.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.450
While you're still human.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.950
Consider it a friendly warning from
an ear who's been tossed aside already.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.500
Is that possible?

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.400
I think so.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.200
Please tell us.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.200
If we go to the boiler room at the heart
of the station, and light the boiler...

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.150
...we'll be able to operate
the central steam crane.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.050
If we use that...

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.200
You can remove the tower?

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.900
Yes.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.800
After that, all we'd have to do is...

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.850
Nameless?

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.250
Where have you been?

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.100
Should I go back and explain
my plan from the beginning?

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.450
It's fine, keep going.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.550
But I hear the boiler room
is a nest of Corpses now.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.900
If we follow this path around the crane...

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:20.450
...it’s a little out of the way, but they will
only be able to attack us in a single file.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.150
We have Nameless, there's nothing to fear.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.750
What do you think, Ayame-sama?

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.400
Yes.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.800
Does anyone know how
to operate the machine?

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.400
I thought we could ask Takumi and Sukari.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.350
I'll light the boiler.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.450
Okay, we will back you up.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.450
Will you help them too, Nameless-san?

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:42.900
Okay.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.000
But...

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.750
...I won't fight together with you.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.850
What are you talking—?

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.500
Why don't you go directly to the boiler room?

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.200
You’re going around because
you’re scared of the Corpses, right?

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.050
I can't fight with cowards like that.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.870
That's not it!

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.390
It's only normal to adapt
the plan so nobody will die.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.590
Stay back!

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:06.850
You'll infect me with your stupidity.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.700
I can't be bothered with some detour.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.350
You can just plod along behind me.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.250
Hey!

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.550
Just make sure you don't
mess up working the machine.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.540
Wait!

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.700
What happened?

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.000
Are you sure about this, Ikoma?

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.550
Ayame-sama, I would reconsider.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.080
It will be fine!

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.050
We have the jet bullets I've made too!

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.750
You're right.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.200
We have to trust this plan...

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.190
Ikoma, we're in your hands.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:38.900
Yes!

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.600
Falter, and he will abandon you too.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.050
I will fight.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.750
And kill the Corpses.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.350
That is what I'm here for.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.850
Nameless-chan.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.400
What's wrong?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.650
Taro died.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.350
We won't be able to run together anymore.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.550
He got his leg hurt in the last Corpses attack.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:22.250
I see.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:28.250
But Taro was lucky, wasn’t he?

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.600
He was able to die before
you threw him aside.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:34.650
Hey, you!

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.150
I mean...

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.200
...what good is a dog with a hurt leg?

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.250
So it’s good he was able to die.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.750
Are you saying that we abandoned Taro?

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.400
I hate you.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:51.750
Get out.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.700
Get out!

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.300
Nameless-chan!

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.500
What's wrong with her?

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.850
She's just a Corpse in the end.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.970
I'm really sorry!

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.100
There was nobody else I could ask!

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.800
D-Don't be stupid!

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.700
Y-You’re the one taking
on the most danger.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.700
O-Operating a crane is a p-piece of cake.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.200
You sure the Warriors are coming too?

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.070
Yes, I can promise you that!

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.700
Ayame-sama gave us her word.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.590
Fine, I guess since I owe you.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.250
Great! Thank you!

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.700
What were you doing?

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.150
Nothing.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.300
Takumi and Sukari said they would help.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.650
Yeah? Good for you.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.650
Did... something happen with you?

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.250
Like what?

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.500
I don't know.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.000
Why won't you fight with us?

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.000
I will.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:20.150
But...

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.900
...I'm just not going with your plan.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.150
Then do whatever you want!

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.200
Just one thing!

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.800
Stay away from the boiler room!

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.100
There's no reason to charge into
the heart of the enemy's nest.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.900
Is Nameless...

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.250
...not here?

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.200
Initiating brakes.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.050
No signs of the Corpses!

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.850
We're counting on you!

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:14.550
This is Car 2.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.200
Kibito's team is deploying!

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.300
We wouldn't survive a fall from this height.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.500
How is it?

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.750
You think you can move it?

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.800
It seems okay!

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.750
Okay, I'll leave you to it!

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:33.950
Be careful!

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.270
Did you replace the piercing gun's gasket?!

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.100
It's okay!

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.050
Let's hurry!

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.600
Hey, look.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.750
Look how mangled that column is.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.400
What could cause something like that?

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.400
What exactly is a Black Smoke of Corpses?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.900
Nameless!

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.800
She's heading for the boiler room...!

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.850
After I warned her not to!

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.200
Damn it!

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.800
Hey, are you going back?

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.850
What do we do, Kibito?

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.100
We can't operate the boiler ourselves.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.500
We'll have to follow.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:15.550
Damn kids.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:20.150
If this is where the enemy nest is,
we'd be better off destroying it!

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.000
I estimate 90 seconds.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:33.500
Fifty-six seconds.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:37.850
I've been cut.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.400
When did that...?

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.250
There's more?

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.400
Fine, then.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.200
I haven't had enough fun yet!

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.300
The Corpses...

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.700
She did this all on her own?

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.250
Nameless!

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:20.950
What took you so long?

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:26.250
If we followed your plan, you would
still be plodding your way there.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.150
Why don't you get to it already?

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.100
What is it?

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.200
The shadow... moved...

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.000
Shadow?

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.800
What are you talk—?

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.550
It's the Corpses!

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.750
What?!

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.500
Are you saying all of those
shadows are Corpses?

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.050
Yeah, that’s what I’m saying!

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:08.150
Taking down whatever Corpses were
here didn't matter at all!

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.990
All it did was provoke them!

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.850
It can’t be.

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:12.900
Damn it!

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.850
Ikoma?!

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.550
Don't worry.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.950
I'll take of this—

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.450
Just shut up for a second!

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.000
It's working!

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:35.750
All right!

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:37.150
You finished?!

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.150
We need to go!

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:40.450
Nameless!

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:42.650
Where's she?

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.050
Hurry up!

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.350
They’re here!

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.850
Purification!

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.150
Ikoma!

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:06.400
There's a horde of Corpses coming!

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.950
Leave the rest to me and
get back to the Iron Fortress!

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.040
What about you, then?

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.600
I’ll meet up with you at the west passage!

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.700
But...!

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.550
One bite and you're finished!

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.950
I'm still a Corpseless if I get bit!

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.850
We'll be waiting for you, okay?

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.200
Damn it, hurry up!

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.900
You're weak.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.450
What are you showing off for?

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:42.800
Nameless!

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:44.850
What are you doing?!

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.050
You get back too!

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:49.800
I'm the Claw...

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.200
...to tear the Corpses open.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.200
Targets...

00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:59.250
...confirmed!

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.150
Ikoma said he would meet
with us at the west passage?

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:07.800
Yes!

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:27.840
Nameless is strong.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.100
I need to operate the crane!

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:44.900
Nameless!

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:02.750
Damn it!

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.100
What is it?!

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.170
The crane stopped.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.600
We can't go on any further!

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:29.650
Hey, are you okay?!

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.350
Ayame-sama, the two Corpseless went over the cliff!

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:44.500
What?!

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.500
W-What is that?

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.400
Don't tell me...

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.950
Is that the Black Smoke?

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:40.900
Even if the stars

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:46.000
That connect you make a sound

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:52.100
There are just dreams in the same rain

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:57.650
And lights are dried up

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:02.900
I am tired of getting answers

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:08.100
By mimicking others

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:13.700
Dawn without the sun

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.900
And broken morning

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:24.750
Smashed cry and dream
The ideal only has its doors

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:30.400
City is uplifted and drown in noise

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.900
I will still sing and stop turning the rudder

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:42.350
To hush silence
