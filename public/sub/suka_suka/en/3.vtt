00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.570
It's been a while, Rhantolk.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.400
I'm glad you're all right.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.050
Likewise.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.380
But what happened to your hair, Chtholly?

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.920
Uh, well...

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.150
And who are you?

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.460
Willem Kmetsch,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.490
fairy warehouse caretaker.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.460
Nice to meet you.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.590
You're disfeatured...

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.440
Are you also a troll?

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.080
Nygglatho's husband?

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.170
No!

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.520
I'm human.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.730
An emnetwiht?

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.510
If that's a joke, it isn't funny.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.460
Never mind me.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.760
There's something I want to ask you.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.240
WorldEnd: What do you do at the end of the
world? Are you busy? Will you save us?

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.770
Stop it!

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.180
That tickles!

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.180
I knew it.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.330
She's showing symptoms of venenum poisoning.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.160
Deal with it, Nopht.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.370
What do you think you're doing?

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.540
Relax. It'll be fine.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.590
How is this "fine"?

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.380
I can't...

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.680
Help, Rhan!

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.880
Unhand Nopht immediately! Or else!

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.910
I sense dirty thoughts.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.540
Feel better now?

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.080
My body feels so light, it's almost creepy.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.090
How unsettling it is to have
your fatigue suddenly disappear.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.640
I told you it'd be fine, didn't I?

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.840
What?

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.600
You can't trust me so easily, huh?

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.680
I mean, you're an emnetwiht.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.690
To accept one of the sinners who
destroyed the world would be messed up.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.840
Everyone who knows has done just that.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.690
So I must be a very lucky man.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.320
I find your relaxed attitude fishy, too.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.740
You must be used to hiding your
evil intent and tricking women.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.840
I'm grateful you helped Chtholly survive
a battle in which she was supposed to die.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.030
But as long as you are an emnetwiht,

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.500
there is no guarantee you aren't a danger.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.980
Do you remember how your people spread
the seventeen beasts across the world?

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.240
A few days after the beasts appeared,
two islands vanished from the map.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.650
When next week came,
five countries, four islands,

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.540
and two oceans were gone.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.430
And the week after that,
the world map had lost all meaning.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.110
Not long after, humanity was wiped out.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.070
How did the beasts increase
so rapidly in number?

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.570
I don't know for sure,

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.580
but I've heard they were originally
some kind of biological weapon.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.410
Biological weapon?

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.750
Then they must have used
some organism as a base, yes?

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.040
From what, exactly,
did the humans create the beasts?

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.670
Beats me.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.080
If they're biological weapons,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.040
then they were created solely to fight.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.380
Just like us...

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.650
No need to know everything about them.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.420
Only that they're archenemies
that make you suffer.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.230
Isn't that right?

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.530
I simply wish to learn the truth.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.970
Well, I don't really mind people like you.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.700
Later.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.300
Sorry. She's usually a nice girl.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.540
I get it...

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.010
I'm gonna check on things over there.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.530
You stay on the ship.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.990
Huh? But...

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.890
Didn't I say not to push yourself?

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.260
Just stay put.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.920
Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him for you.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.720
Keep an eye on me? Why?

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.320
You were having dirty thoughts about Rhan.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.390
Forget about that...

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.300
Jeez, always treating me like a kid.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.840
Sure, Rhan has a more mature aura...

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.350
All right! Last one!

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.990
Now, which one is it?

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.740
Gotcha!

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.420
Oh, come on! Not again!

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.750
Ribbit all!

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.500
Quit croaking. What are you, a baby?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.870
A tadpole? You ain't got legs there?

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.950
Tadpoles don't croak!

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.950
Quit spacing out.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.380
S-Sorry.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.450
If it isn't Madam Secretary.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.320
What brings you here?

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.020
Wanna join us for a drink?

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.160
I can't believe she's just a disfeatured kid.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.390
Kid or not, she's an esteemed secretary.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.700
Indeed.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.270
She helps our honorable technical officer.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.300
In more ways than one.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.900
Would you help us out in
more ways than one, too?

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.860
Just ribbing!

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.230
You probably don't need to
worry about Nopht and Rhantolk.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.570
They have never been the kind
to seriously hate someone.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.780
Yeah, I get it.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.790
Thanks.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.910
You've always got my back.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.500
I appreciate it, really.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.500
Yep.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.820
I do because you might break otherwise.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.680
Do I really seem that fragile?

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.350
But thank you.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.340
Keep looking out for Chtholly, too.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.050
Sure.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.730
Ground Level K96-MAL Ruins

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.440
You moron!

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.940
What have you done?

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.920
I'm a first-grade technical
officer, you know?

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.950
The highest-ranking officer here, you know?

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.070
I don't care! Who died and made you boss?

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.450
I see you're as loud as ever.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.710
Willem!

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.320
Do you know this man,
Second-Grade Technical Officer?

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.150
Yes.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.950
What's up?

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.480
This idiot sent an extra
excavation squad underground.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.550
We have to grab as many relics
as possible before we leave.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.440
Do you realize how crucial this operation is?

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.980
Sending too many men underground at once
is considered a bad idea.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.440
That's probably just a myth.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.870
It's real!

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.170
As far as I know,

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.240
no group of more than seven
has ever returned alive!

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.660
That's why we salvagers
tend to work in small groups.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.940
Well, no point complaining now.
They've already left.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.340
All we can do is prepare for the worst.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.880
Is that all right, sir wise
First-Grade Technical Officer?

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.040
Very well.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.380
See how bighearted a first-grade
technical officer I am?

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.450
Take care of things here.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.300
Thank you, sir.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.730
I didn't expect you to show up, Willem.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.190
And I didn't expect you to be here, Grick.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.860
Wow, another cutie pie.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.200
Met Nopht and Rhantolk yet?

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.610
Yeah.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.870
You were right.
These fairies really are nice girls.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.270
I won't walk one down the aisle.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.160
Get away. Your eyes are scary.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.460
Oh, right.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.490
Will the entire haul be
loaded on the Plantaginesta?

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.820
Yeah, including everything on the Saxifraga.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.800
Why?

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.680
I'm looking for something.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.480
Adviser, we need your help here.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.460
Coming.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.900
See you later.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.140
You too, missy.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.320
All done.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.220
Ribbit?

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.810
There.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.360
I'm done, boss.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.160
Thank you.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.620
I told her not to push herself...

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.130
My, if it isn't the technical officer.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.780
What brings you down here?

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.090
Sure you shouldn't be with
your esteemed secretary?

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.790
My esteemed secretary is kinda busy.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.390
Say, where's the dug weapon you found?

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.840
No idea.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.340
Our orders were simply to carry it here.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.980
We lost a lot of men in the attack.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.360
How are we supposed to
keep track of everything?

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.230
Oh...

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.030
So I'm looking for a needle in a haystack?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.340
An earthquake?

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.540
Be careful!

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.870
We have a big one today.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.500
There have been lots of tremors lately.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.430
Lillia...

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.640
Who are you?

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.310
What do you want?

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.190
I'm Lillia Asplay...

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.780
Just a brave who's gonna
kill you to save the world!

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.520
Sounds like a pain.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.300
It really is!

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.580
Why do you wanna save the world?

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.260
For the one... I love.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.680
Goodbye...

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:34.600
And rest in peace!

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.180
I'm Chtholly.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.250
All right, I'm still fine.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:58.790
Here you are.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.080
When was the last time
I had a soup this good?

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.340
Seconds please, Madam Secretary!

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.430
Coming right up!

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.930
Yum! This is seriously great!

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:15.250
The kick of the pepper,
and this rich mouthfeel...

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.250
So good!

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.960
How, and when, did Chtholly
become such a good cook?

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.230
It's the power of love.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.880
Why so mad?

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.080
Scared someone's gonna
steal your Chtholly away?

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.330
Hey, Casanova Officer.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.210
You'd better make Madam Secretary happy.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.290
She'll make a great wife.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.180
If you make her sad...

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.260
Don't make me spell it out for mew.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.050
Screw you!

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.390
"A great wife," my foot!

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.260
"Make her happy," my ass!

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.780
You don't have to tell me. I already...

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.940
I already... what?

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.920
Don't come crying to me if you trip.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.200
What does this part say?

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.740
"Carried the corpse of a god to the city."

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.920
The text is blurry after
that, so I cannot read it.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.420
May that god have mercy on their souls.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.800
I love it! Thanks!

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.560
You're welcome.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.720
Next!

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.600
Wow, you're good.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.180
Well, I am working on a bunch of my skills.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.240
Chtholly, may I ask you something?

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.230
What?

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.350
Why did you come to the surface?

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.570
For that Willem guy?

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.740
Is it because he saved your life?

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.440
He may usually look relaxed,
but he always walks a tightrope.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.950
He's really awkward,
and he overthinks everything.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.920
So, well, you know...

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.460
She just wants to be with him.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.150
Ow!

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.880
Hey, Ren!

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.030
Damn that jerk!

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.010
She's too good for him!

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.680
Well, I'm rooting for you two!

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.430
Oh? Is that how it is, Chtholly?

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.920
Don't you start, too!

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.480
Whoa!

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.300
Did you sort them all yourself?

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.150
Why are you two here?

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.120
We figured we could help you
look for that dug weapon.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.070
Huh? What brought that on?

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.580
We heard a bunch of stuff about you.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.030
You're taking good care
of the little ones, huh?

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.220
Sheesh.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.280
You didn't hear anything weird, right?

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.470
Like how you and Chtholly
are close to hooking up,

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.600
or how Ithea thinks you like young girls?

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.720
Never mind! Forget I asked.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.430
We aren't doing this for you.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:00.730
It's for Chtholly.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.100
Thanks.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.980
But I'll be fine.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.400
This is my job.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.070
I want to find it myself.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.680
Oh, right. Bring me your swords.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.860
I'll tune them while I'm at it.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.310
What the heck?

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.230
What is this?

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.920
It wasn't on the list.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.010
There you are.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.990
Oh, Chtholly... What's up?

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.790
I'm giving out lunch boxes to those
who can't make it to the mess hall.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.210
This one is for you.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.890
Listen, the secretary
thing is just an excuse.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.080
You don't have to go so far.

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.090
If I just sat around, doing nothing,

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:16.240
you really would have brought
along your useless lover.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.950
Who cares?

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.850
I care.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.890
Is that so?

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.420
Is that Nopht's sword?

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.370
I found the other one, too.

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:29.500
The other one?

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.280
There.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.110
That's Lapidemsibilus.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.620
I'll have to take a closer look at it
once we get back.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.080
You really found it for me.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:04.330
Do you still remember that
night when I tuned Seniorious?

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.340
Yeah.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:10.480
And also Nephren, Nopht, Rhantolk, and Ithea.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.480
I remember them.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.710
Though I'm not sure if I remember everything.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:16.660
I see.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.910
Now that we have the sword,
we won't have to worry.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:21.340
Yeah.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:25.590
What's the matter?

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.790
There isn't anything wrong with it.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.690
Of course there isn't.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:33.210
If there were, Nopht would've
been in real trouble by now.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.010
Not that... This sword is the Kinslayer.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.280
And what about it?

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.470
It specializes in killing
one's kin, one's own kind.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:48.180
In other words, it's a sword that can only
be used by humans to kill humans.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.820
But Nopht's fighting beasts with it.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:00.110
That's why I thought there must be
something wrong with it.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:04.250
How else could she fight beasts
with a sword that only kills humans?

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.080
Willem?

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.540
A sword that only kills humans...

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.630
Then they must have used
some organism as a base, yes?

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.670
From what, exactly,
did the humans create the beasts?

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.680
No...

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:26.000
A few days after the beasts appeared,
two islands vanished from the map.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.520
When next week came,
five countries, four islands,

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.260
and two oceans were gone.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:35.180
And the week after that,
the world map had lost all meaning.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.690
Not long after, humanity was wiped out.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.620
How did the beasts increase
so rapidly in number?

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.410
It can't be...

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.270
No need to know everything about them.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.500
Only that they're archenemies
that make you suffer.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.540
I simply wish to learn the truth.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.880
You mean the ones making
Chtholly and the rest...

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:01.010
The ones making Chtholly suffer are...

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.150
That's right.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.890
Humans did destroy the surface.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.620
Willem?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.240
Willem? Seriously, what's the matter?

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:26.630
Talk to me!

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.400
Not losing your cool?

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.450
For what it's worth,
my heart is about to explode.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:52.180
But while I don't know what happened,

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.650
you're showing me your weak side,
when you usually act so tough.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.000
So when you combine my resulting happiness
with my desire to see you feel better,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.530
they take priority.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:05.500
You...

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:10.120
Right now, you look like
you might vanish if left alone.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.390
Sure, this is embarrassing,
but I can't push you away.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.700
You're a great gal.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.570
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:21.690
Come again?

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.340
Never mind.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.270
Hey, don't be a sore loser.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:29.560
Say it again. Just one more time.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.720
Marry me.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.100
Not tha...

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.480
Wha?

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.100
You helped me find what I needed.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.370
Something I want to protect.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.630
A home to return to.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.620
A reason to keep living.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:57.510
You helped me realize that
it's okay for me to live on.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.080
So I promise...

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.050
I'll make you happy.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.540
Yeah.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.910
I want to stay by your side, too.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.970
Let's be together forever.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.120
H-Help—

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:09.710
Next Episode

evidence of existence.
