00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.080
Don't let the pressure drop!

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.120
We stop, we die!

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.750
Yes, sir!

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.180
Make the announcement.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.910
Roger.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.010
We're passing through the abandoned station.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.240
All hands, brace for impact.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.870
Damn it!

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.960
Stay back!

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.590
Stay the fuck back!

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.150
To survive, what you need...

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.140
is not some tool that will
keep you safely hidden away.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.980
It's the power to fight the Corpses without fear.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.070
Shingo!

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.940
Are you okay!?

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.280
Yeah.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.350
I owe you one.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.170
Your hand!

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.020
Twenty years ago,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.490
the people of Hinomoto sought refuge from the Corpses behind the walls of stations.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.200
Casting aside both friends and dignity alike,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.900
they fled for their lives.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.360
Use it.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.900
Use the suicide bag!

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.250
Hurry up!

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.980
Show us your resolve!

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.160
Don't be a disgrace!

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.000
What are you doing!?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.530
Pull it already!

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.920
Can we truly be proud of a life built upon the sacrifices of others?

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.630
We lose so much more than just their lives.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.400
That's why...

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.430
I...

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.710
Mother...

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.080
Damn it!

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.590
I want the power to slay Corpses.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.140
I'm so close!

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.520
You're awake.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.920
The Knights held them off.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.050
You can go back to sleep.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.610
For now.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.620
Did another station get overrun?

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.410
Corpse

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.410
Episode

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.410
Frightened

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.410
One

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.560
Hey, did you hear?

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.630
They said the supplies are late.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.440
I heard the front line retreated again.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.450
How long do you think this dump'll last?

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.490
Hey, cut it out!

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.870
What if a Knight heard you?

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.210
Hey there, hero!

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.550
Bit late, eh?

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.040
Your hair's still lookin' a mess.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.530
Careful with your calculations.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.860
What? No way...

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.390
Plate 3 needs more adhesive.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.390
Hey,

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.850
Ikoma!

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.190
How'd it go yesterday?

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.520
No good.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.940
The pressure should've been enough, but...

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.360
Remind me what's wrong with using normal lead shots again?

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.660
Because that'd be no different to the Knights' steam guns.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.120
They'll just bounce straight off the Corpse's heartcage.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.000
That's why we need jet bullets.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.010
We need more penetrating power.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.050
And you're gonna use that to fight the Corpses in the Knights' stead?

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.300
You must've hit your head on something.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.930
Did you up the explosives?

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.890
Come on, you just increased the cavity size in the last tune-up, remember?

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.980
That's it, Takumi!

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.480
Why did I skip a step?

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.770
Where are you going?

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.650
I'm going home and redoing it.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.780
Hey, hey,

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.700
at least finish your work here first.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.950
Hey, it's Lady Ayame.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.410
From the Yomokawa family?

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.620
I'd like to personally inspect it all.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.710
What a pleasant surprise, Lady Ayame.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.670
How could we possibly help you?

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.750
This is my father's steam gun.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.920
There appears to be a problem with it,
so I was hoping someone might take a look.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.010
Of course, we would be glad to.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.010
The good Lady Ayame.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.630
At least she's easy on the eyes.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.300
She's the princess of the Knights.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.930
Ikoma!

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.430
Come here and assist Lady Ayame!

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.690
It's your calling, hero!

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.530
Allow me.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.620
So, you wish to become a hero?

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.580
I just hate running away.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.250
Lady Ayame,

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.090
where will you be pointing this?

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.090
The west gate is opening!

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.470
The Iron Fortress is coming!

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.100
Was the Iron Fortress not
scheduled to arrive tomorrow?

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.350
Let us go.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.360
The Iron Fortress?

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.280
But the Fusang Fortress is also coming tonight.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.120
Two railforts in one day?

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.870
Father,

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.500
was the Iron Fortress not supposed to arrive tomorrow?

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.380
Hayatani Station has fallen.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.050
With fewer stops to make,
an earlier arrival is only natural.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.340
But...

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.340
Get the inspection box!

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.850
You think some unlucky guy got bitten?

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.860
That's what they're about to find out.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.900
They'll search for bite marks to see if anyone's been infected by a Corpse.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.860
If they find one, they'll throw them in jail.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.370
It's what the authorities always do.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.120
Yeah, well, can you blame them?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.200
They could be incubating the infection.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.620
All right, begin maintenance!

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.920
Hey, look.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.170
It's just the cartoid artery that's thicker.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.390
So the virus really does pass through here.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.300
Hey!

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.680
You don't come across
specimens of this quality often.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.470
That's taboo!

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.010
This isn't some curse.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.520
You and I both know that!

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.900
Who's that?

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.530
Some kinda bigwig?

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.120
What's wrong?

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.830
Uh, nothing.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.290
Hey, kid!

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.000
The exit is over on the other side.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.710
Children aren't exempt from the inspection!

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:56.550
Only a fool would judge a book by its cover.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.910
That's what my brother always told me, Mr. Mustache.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.270
Wh-What did you call me!?

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.560
Leave it.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.020
She is my guest.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.480
M-Milord!

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.320
Are you the boss here?

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.780
I am Kenshou, head of the Yomokawa family.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.320
Lord Yomokawa, thank you for your hospitality.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.410
Priest Shimon, I presume.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.740
I have read your letter.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.950
We would like to take you to our mansion first.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.210
They're not going to be inspected?

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.880
What the hell's going on?

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.920
Who are they?

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.050
Dunno.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.130
It's a Corpse!

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.640
He has an injury!

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.220
Don't let him get away!

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.720
A Corpse?

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.020
Stop right there!

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.100
No! I'm not a Corpse!

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.520
Stop!

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.780
Kill him!

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.280
Surround and kill him!

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:56.900
I swear, I'm not one of them!

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.370
Please help me!

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.620
Stop it!

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.410
Who the hell are you, kid!?

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:09.880
He's saying he's not a Corpse!

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.630
Like hell we can trust him!

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.380
Stop, you coward!

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.970
Those suspected of being a Corpse

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.470
are to be locked up for three days and kept under watch.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.850
You're the ones who made that rule!

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:24.970
Shut your damn mouth!

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.520
This matter doesn't concern a lowly steam-smith!

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:35.030
I'm trying to tell you that you're pointing your guns at the wrong targets!

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.530
Father, please!

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.660
Corpse hearts!

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.540
Disgusting!

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.040
Why does he have them?

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:50.880
Answer me!

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.960
Why do you have something like that!?

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.550
He's getting away!

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.300
Stop!

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.230
He died...

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.440
Which means...

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.650
He wasn't a Corpse?

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.820
Aren't you ashamed to be scared of every damn thing?

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.240
You're madmen!

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.910
How lofty your words are.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:34.000
A privilege you enjoy only because the very earth you step on is under the Knights' tireless guard.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.460
You're wrong!

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.750
I'll fight too!

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:37.920
Kurusu!

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.010
Yes, sir.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:40.720
I'm close to finishing my Piercing Ca—

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.260
Throw him in jail.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.890
He may be a Corpse.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:49.770
Father!

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:52.770
Let us go.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.190
Ayame,

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.900
maintaining order, too, is a Knight's duty.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.570
Order?

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.850
KABANERI OF THE IRON FORTRESS

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.500
I see.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.000
You're both headed to Kongoukaku?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.130
With the Lord Shogun?

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.130
No, not at this time.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.260
That is why the two of us are going alone.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.530
June, huh?

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.440
It's almost time, Brother.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.370
I knew it!

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.370
You're the body gatherer!

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.830
You're...

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.130
No-name.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.460
No-name?

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.630
Is that really your name?

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.050
Isn't it nice?

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.880
My brother gave it to me.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.850
Hey, did you know that the guy from before wasn't a Corpse?

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.640
No, but I couldn't just ignore what was happening.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.810
Any normal person would, though.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.020
Then there's something wrong with being normal.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.280
You're an interesting one!

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.570
What do you mean?

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.240
I mean, it's normal to be scared of Corpses, right?

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.970
People are just frightened cowards in general.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.300
They can't help it.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.540
Yes, they can.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.130
We have no choice but kill others out of fear?

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.170
I can't accept that.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.670
We cannot lose our humanity to fear.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.060
Ikoma's a freaking dumbass,
getting all worked up like that.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.230
What a self-righteous idiot.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.100
But you know...

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.730
I couldn't do something like that if I tried.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.570
Talking back to a Knight like that.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.700
That's exactly why he's an idiot!

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.580
The Fusang Fortress is here!

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.580
It's right on schedule this time.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.600
It's going too fast!

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.140
Slow down!

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.200
Damn it! Raise the bridge!

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.190
Hurry up!

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:51.870
It won't make it in time!

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:14.140
What's happening!?

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.730
It's the Corpses!

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.020
Out of the way!

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:42.830
It's the Corpses!

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.170
Is that... the alarm?

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.090
Don't tell me...

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.180
The Corpses are here!?

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.600
I have to go.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.820
I need to get my Piercing Cannon!

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.530
Quickly, dear!

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.240
I'm taking these too.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:33.930
No-name,

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.510
they've broken through the west gate.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.040
This whole place is lost.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:38.510
But—

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.270
We're going to the Iron Fortress.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.140
Come.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.150
Father, where are you going?

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.190
To the Iron Fortress.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.650
Surely you're not...

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.280
You would abandon this station?

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.110
I will give the signal when the
Iron Fortress has been secured.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.740
When you see it, come.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.420
The Corpses react to blood.

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:16.840
Fuck, it hurts like hell!

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.220
Hold it! Take off your clothes immediately!

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.730
You fuckin' kidding me!? The Corpses are coming!

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.350
Prove that you don't have any marks on your body!

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.610
What's going to happen to us?

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:30.610
Where's Ikoma?

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.450
He took the bait!

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.500
I won't fail this time!

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.830
I've increased the explosive load!

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.960
I did it!

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.210
My Piercing Cannon punched straight through its heart!

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.970
This thing!

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.590
That I made!

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.770
I see it.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.690
It's the Iron Fortress.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.400
Lady No-name.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.990
You must continue on your journey alone.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.540
Go to Kongoukaku and await the Young Master's orders.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.880
I leave the rest in your hands.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.880
May fortune smile upon you in the next life.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.870
It's not a curse.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.330
I just need to make sure the virus doesn't reach my brain!

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.090
Five years...

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.250
It's been five long years.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.220
Giving blood, sweat and tears...

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.220
to finally be able to fight the Corpses.

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.620
I'm...

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.330
no longer the person I was back then.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.830
I will never, ever...

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:36.590
Ever run again!

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.690
This time...

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.610
I...

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.490
I will become a person I can be proud of!

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.100
I will always remember

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.100
omoi dasu darou

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.940
the day I lost myself

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.940
ano hi no jouki ni

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:47.110
boku wo ushinatte

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:47.110
in the steam

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:53.120
Traces of mistakes from our past

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:53.120
musuu ni aru

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.010
were still visible

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.010
ayamachi no ato

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:58.860
susumedo michi ga

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:58.860
But I kept moving forward

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.590
with no path to follow

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.590
mienu toki ni

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.300
omae wa itta

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.300
You said to me

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.040
in that night of blood and flesh

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.040
niku ya chi no yoru

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.760
sono chi ni toe

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.760
to search my blood

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.950
kotae no kodou

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.950
for a heartbeat

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:19.460
Demicorpse of the Iron Fortress,

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:19.460
koutetsu no kabaneri yo

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.530
saa tachiagare

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.530
it's time to stand up

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:27.760
Toss away all that belongs to you

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:27.760
ono ga subete chi ni tataki tsuke ima

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.160
Let your soul devote itself

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.160
sono kokoro wa

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.060
chikatta tomo no tame ni

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.060
to the friends you swore to protect

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.000
moyase yo sono inochi

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.000
Ignite your life

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.050
kaete yuke sekai wo

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.050
and change the world

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.580
agrgregergregerger

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.580
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
