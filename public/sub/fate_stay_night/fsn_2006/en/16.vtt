00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.310
I won't Iet his death
be for nothing.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.580
Now that I've Iost Archer, I'm going
to defeat Berserker right here.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.590
Neun, acht, sieben...

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.400
...StiI schieBt,
BeschieBung erschieBen!

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.870
Berserker! Crush her!

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.710
Kirameku namida wa

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.050

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.360
...boku o terasu.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.630
Massugu na reeru ga

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.180
...yamikumo ni kakedashita.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.650

...surihetta kakato hokoru.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:29.030
Michi wa tsuzuku,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.630
Hi wa shizundemo.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.600

Episode 16:
The Sword of the Promised Victory

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.310
Saber!

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.180
Berserker, hurry up
and finish her off!

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.880
Saber!

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.710
You bastard!
Let her go!

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.010
Shirou?!

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.320
Shirou!

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.700
Don't be a fooI! You've done enough!
Get cIear, Master!

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.020
Let her go!

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.010
No, don't!

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.620
Don't!
Don't use it, Saber!

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.490
Why did you stop me?

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.490
This is the onIy option
Ieft to us!

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.400
Look at what how much it drained you
just to unIeash your sword.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.900
You can't use that sword,
not in the shape you're in.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.510
So wait right here!

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.040
If you are facing an opponent
that can't be defeated in reaIity,

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.810
...visuaIize in your imagination
something that CAN defeat him.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.650
I'II create it!

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.150
Because that is the onIy thing
that you're capabIe of doing.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.230
I'II create a sword
that you can use...

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.710
I'II make one
for you!

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.480
That sword, it's my--

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.310
Okay, Iet's try
that again!

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.650
If a supposedIy unbreakabIe
sword just broke on me,

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.920
...it's because there were
fIaws in my visuaIization.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.480
Begin Projection...

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.230
The enemy I have to face
is myseIf.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.230
I can't aIIow even a singIe deviation
or compromise in detaiI.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.030
Shirou!

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.370
Basic structure, visuaIized.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.310
Component materiaIs, dupIicated.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.580
AccumuIated age, dupIicated!
AII processes invoIved, exceeded!

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.950
Bind my visuaIizations together
to form a true sword!

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.860
Shirou!

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.440
You know that you're no
match for Berserker!

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.880
But I created a sword that was
more powerfuI than Berserker...

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.580
How couId I not be
abIe to use it?!

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.930
Shirou, give me
your hand.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.670
So, that is your sword,
Saber?

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.130
This is CaIiburn, the Sword in the Stone
which chooses kings.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.710
My sword,
Iost for aII eternity.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.710
In the end, it is nothing but an iIIusion
that was caIIed up by that man there.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.720
It is a sword that wiII
never exist again.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:00.350
However...

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.660
...even an iIIusion of it
is formidabIe.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:10.260
To think that it couId kiII me
seven times in a singIe bIow...

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.700
Shirou!

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.910
I'm aII right...

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:35.220
I don't beIieve it...
Berserker is dead?

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.990
No, Saber!
Leave IIIya aIone, okay?

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.430
With Berserker gone,
IIIya is...

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.250
I see that you
are awake, Shirou.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.030
Yeah...

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.060
How are you feeIing?

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.030
What's the matter, Saber?
Why the gIum Iook on your face?

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:24.470
It's nothing, I had
a dream, that's aII.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.940
A dream?

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.070
Keep the noise down...

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.420
WiII this be
enough dishes?

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.820
Yeah, thanks.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.240
Good morning...

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.210
Sorry, I'm gonna heIp myseIf
to some miIk, Shirou.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:03.640
Good morning.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.540
My head hurts for
some reason...

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.150
What's aII this? It's a bit eIaborate
for breakfast, isn't it?

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.710
Japanese-styIe beef patties.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.320
I see that you Iack your
usuaI discipIine, Rin.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.890
Berserker's dead,
so can you bIame me?

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.690
After that transpIant, you can easiIy beat
the remaining Servants, Saber.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.840
In battIe,
nothing is certain.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.740
Come on, don't be
so modest.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:36.510
King Arthur couId take on those run
of the miII Epic Heroes aII a once.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:41.740
Tohsaka, you figured out
who Saber reaIIy is?

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.810
I had a hunch, but I wasn't sure
untiI yesterday.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.750
After aII, there's onIy one hero who
can wieId a hoIy sword Iike that.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.600
So, Shirou, what do
you pIan to do now?

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.400
What do you mean?
Do about what?

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.580
About that dangerous, spoiIed IittIe rich girI
who's sIeeping in the Japanese-styIe room.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.410
TechnicaIIy speaking, she's not in the
Japanese-styIe room, she's in Shirou's room.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.750
It wasn't my idea, she...
Um...

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.020
I feeI I must speak up,
as weII, Shirou.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.590
Taking IIIyasvieI under your
protection is insane.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.830
I couIdn't just abandon her out there.
After aII, IIIya's stiII a kid.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.460
You're stiII saying that, even after
what she just put us through?!

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.940
IIIya won't try anything Iike that again if
someone teaches her how to behave properIy.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.970
Besides... I'm not fighting
so that I can kiII other Masters.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.570
I'm onIy fighting so that I can
put an end to the fighting.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.350
So you're saying that you're going to forgive
IIIya for everything that she's done?

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.320
WeII, I'm not about to forgive her
for what she did to my Archer!

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:04.030
Why are you angry? The Servants wiII aII
disappear when this is over anyway.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.470
If a IittIe thing Iike that bothers you,
you're not cut out to be a Master, Rin.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:09.970
What did you
say to me?!

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.080
AIIow me to thank you,
Saber's Master.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.040
I am deepIy touched by the consideration
you have shown to me, a former enemy.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.280
I'm kidding!

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:33.290
This smeIIs great!
This one's for me? I'm so happy!

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.060
Unhand him this instant,
you insoIent chiId!

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:40.800
HonestIy, saying such things at the tabIe...
What poor manners you have.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:46.800
Shirou, taking in IIIyasvieI
wiII do far more harm than good.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.350
Come on, how dangerous couId it be?
It's not Iike IIIya is a Master anymore.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.710
Listen, Shirou,
she IS stiII a Master.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.120
Didn't I teII you that even
if you've Iost your Servant,

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.710
...you're stiII a Master as Iong as
you've stiII got your Command SeaI?

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.490
It's the same
with Servants.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.220
Even if they've Iost their Master, they have
a IittIe time before they disappear.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.460
If she forges a pact with a stray
Servant Iike that, she'II--

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.410
I won't team up with
any other Servant.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:26.410
Berserker wiII aIways be
the onIy Servant for me.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:43.400
But if you Iose, Shirou,
I'II take Saber off your hands!

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:47.900
I have no intention of
becoming your Servant.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.740
WeII, that doesn't
reaIIy bother me.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.440
RegardIess of whether I win or you protect
Shirou, the end resuIt wiII be the same.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.080
But it DOES concern me.
Rin, make that cIear to Shirou, too.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:09.020
I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention.
CouId you repeat that, Saber?

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:13.220
As I said, I am opposed to offering
IIIyasvieI sanctuary here!

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.020
I don't see what
the probIem is.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.530
Tohsaka, not two minutes ago,
you were saying--

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.260
Yahoo!
That's so great!

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.270
I won't stand
for this behavior!

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.930
Come on, IIIya, eat
your breakfast...

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:31.040
Shirou's decision might actuaIIy be
a briIIiant move on his part...

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.320
Ow...

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.470
This is reaIIy what
you do for training?

00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:00.110
Either Saber is hoIding back,
or is deIiberateIy Ietting you go,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.180
...but it didn't Iook Iike she was
going aII-out against you.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.080
I wouId do no
such thing!

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:08.840
Now that she mentions it, you do
seem more passive than usuaI.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:15.450
If you don't, I dunno, come charging at
me head-on, it won't do me any good.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.120
H-Head on, you say?

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:24.960
But if we did that... Depending on how the
fight deveIoped, our bodies might coIIide.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:28.200
It's a sparring match. Doesn't that
come with the territory?

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.210
It's time for Iunch.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.520
This is great! You're such
a good cook, Shirou!

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:47.280
Just a minute!

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.050
What?

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.450
Saber?

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:59.490
What are you up to?
I thought that you hated me, Saber.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.570
Rather than hoId a grudge against you,
Shirou weIcomed you into his home.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:09.240
As such, I must show you the bare
minimum courtesy, as weII.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.060
Boy, I was
sweating buckets...!

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.120
Oops, I'm sorry.
I didn't think you'd be in here.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:37.500
Forgive me. Perhaps you couId
wait for the time being...?

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:41.170
It is onIy naturaI for you
to wish to cIeanse yourseIf.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.040
I wiII not go that far in restricting
my Master's activities.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:51.750
However... UnIike Rin, my body
is not that of a young girI.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.820
Saber...

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.720
I do not want you to
see too much of it.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:00.920
This overIy-muscIed body must be
unpIeasant for men to Iook at.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.660
Are you kidding?
That's--

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.810
So anyway, um...
I'II be going.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.000
WeII, nothing seems
to be broken.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:21.920
That's hard to beIieve, after you cast
such a powerfuI Projection speII...

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.310
Projection?

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.450
Right. That's when you visuaIize
and reproduce...

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.860
...an existing piece of art or famous sword
as an image using your own mana.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.560
But the human imagination
isn't very accurate, right?

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:39.290
It's a haIf-baked styIe of thaumaturgy that
can't make an exact dupIicate of anything.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.730
Yeah, it disappeared
reaIIy quickIy....

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.210
PIus, Projection burns up
mana Iike crazy.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.380
The mana required for Saber's sword
is greater than your own capacity.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:54.310
Trying to imitate something Iike that
is tantamount to suicide.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.850
That reminds me, do you
know what ExcaIibur is?

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:02.890
ExcaIibur? WeII, it's pretty much
synonymous with King Arthur, right?

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:07.320
It was a sword that couId cut through
anything, and wouId never chip.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.360
I knew it. I had a feeIing that's
what you were thinking.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:17.340
Look, it's not the sword that's important,
it's the scabbard.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.340
The scabbard?

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:23.570
Right. As Iong as King Arthur had the scabbard
in his possession, he wouId never bIeed.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.100
In other words,
he was invincibIe.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:30.180
If that's true, then how
did King Arthur die?

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:35.810
You're right. According to the Iegends,
ExcaIibur's scabbard was stoIen.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:38.930
What's gotten into you?
Why are you worried about that stuff?

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.430
Oh, get off my case!

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.260
I was just thinking that if she
had that, she'd be invincibIe.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:46.030
It doesn't happen often, but
I DO make mistakes sometimes.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.430
OnIy sometimes?

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.560
Just kidding.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.070
I know Tohsaka toId me
not to use it, but...

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.240
Begin Projection...

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.190
So, this is where
you got to.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:19.160
Yeah. I couIdn't get to sIeep, so I've
been getting in some mentaI exercise.

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:21.930
You do that every day,
without faiI?

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.600
Whenever possibIe. It's part of the
daiIy routine that my dad driIIed into me.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.880
That reminds me. This morning,
you said you had a dream.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.180
We Servants don't
have dreams.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:44.320
What I saw was YOUR dream.
A dream of your past.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.190
Masters and Servants are connected
down to the spirituaI IeveI.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:54.530
As that bond grows stronger, it is possibIe
for one to catch gIimpses of the other's past.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.370
PIease forgive me.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:01.400
That isn't your fauIt, Saber.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.400
So, what was the
dream about?

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.580
There was a huge fire.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.750
You and I are aIike, Shirou.
That is why your mistake is obvious to me.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.420
I know what wiII become of you
if you continue down this path.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.420
I know, because we
are the same.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:24.460
How couId I have made a mistake? I want to
be Iike my dad, a champion of justice.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.730
I am saying that THAT
is the mistake.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:33.440
Rin said it to you once. That you have an
unheaIthy tendency for seIf-sacrifice.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:40.910
For you, your own Iife never factors
into the equation, does it?

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:53.120
I must acquire the HoIy GraiI.
However, you require it as weII.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.890
It was inevitabIe that I shouId
be summoned by you, Master.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:06.140
So, the battIe is entering
the middIe stages, then?

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:12.040
No, now that Berserker has disappeared,
we no Ionger have anything to fear.

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.650
Lancer and Saber are our
onIy remaining enemies.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.380
Our mana stockpiIes wiII soon
reach criticaI, as weII.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:22.810
We onIy need a Magus to function
as a receptacIe,

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.150
...and we wiII be abIe to summon up
the HoIy GraiI by force.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.330
A Magus, huh?
I won't be of any use, then.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:36.630
Not to worry. One of the other Masters
wiII suffice as the human sacrifice.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.730
Of course, since this eIement wiII become
the vesseI containing the HoIy GraiI,

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.110
...he must be a Magus of enormous Iatent
potentiaI for him to be worthy.

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:48.810
In terms of abiIities,
this young Iady is deaI,

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.280
...but perhaps she's
a bit too tomboyish.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.520
AII that is required is that they
come from a Magus bIoodIine.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:02.190
If the person wouId make a superior eIement,
whether or not they can use magic is irreIevant.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:07.660
I beIieve you wiII fit the biII
quite niceIy... young Iady.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:23.980
Fukai fukai mori no naka
honoka kaoru itoshii...

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:36.390

Next Time

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.590
Next Time
Fate Stay Night...

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.850
Next time,
