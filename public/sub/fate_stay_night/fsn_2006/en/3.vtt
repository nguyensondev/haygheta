00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.980
I am your Servant, a Saber. I am come
in response to your summons.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.860
I ask you...
Are you my Master?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.260
Master?

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.160
I am your Servant, a Saber. I am come
in response to your summons.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.340
Master, your orders.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.800
My sword will henceforth
be at your side.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.500
Your fate is henceforth
my fate.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.050
The pact is concluded.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.140
Wha...?

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.450
Hey! Wait!

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:03.030
My cry doesn't reach the image
of the day I saw in a dream.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:15.780
No matter how I picture my future self, it is
always steeped in hope that will never fade.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:29.320
Reach out your hand and catch
the falling pieces,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:43.910
...then hold my trembling heart
and leap into the night!

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:55.320
Isn't it enough to live for someone else
and let this moment be all there is?

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:07.800
Let's gently cast aside our false selves
and just be who we really are.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:15.000
Episode 3:
Opening Act

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.210
An invisible sword?

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.140
What's the meaning of this, you coward?
How dare you keep your weapon hidden?!

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.420
What's the matter,
Lancer?

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.630
Stopping mid-fight will disgrace
spearmen everywhere.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.290
If you won't come to me,
then I shall come to you.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.130
Let me ask you one thing first.
What's your Noble Phantasm? A sword?

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.440
Perhaps, perhaps not.
It might be an axe. Or a spear.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.240
No, it might even be
a bow.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.450
Get real, Saber...

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.710
This is our first encounter.
What say we stop now and call it a draw?

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.520
I think not.
You will meet your end here.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.080
My objective all along
was to gather information.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.990
I never planned to hang around
if anyone's Servant showed up.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.930
But now I'll have
your heart!

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.470
GÃ¡e Bolg!

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.710
A curse? No, was that
a cause-effect reversal?

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.350
So, you dodged the death blow
of my GÃ¡e Bolg...

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.490
GÃ¡e Bolg? Are you then Ireland's
Son of Light?

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.820
GÃ¡e Bolg, the enchanted thorn
which breaches any and all defenses...

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.210
First comes the effect,
the piercing of the heart,

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.440
...and then the movement of the spear
is altered to cause that effect.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.240
So, that is the cursed spear
wielded by the Hound of Culann...

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.540
Damn, I blew it. I put myself at risk if
I use that attack and the person survives...

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.820
I swear, there's such a thing
as being too famous...

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.820
Servants are supposed to fight to the death
when their true identity is discovered.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.350
But unfortunately, my employer
is a coward.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.070
The guy said to return to him
if my attack ever failed.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.500
You're running away?!

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.910
Feel free to follow me. But if you do,
you better be prepared to die!

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.900
Hold it!

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.140
Hey, he's...

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.390
Who the heck ARE you?

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.720
Need you even ask?
I am your Servant, a Saber.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.430
It was you who summoned me,
so surely there is no need to ask.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.430
Saber Servant?

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.730
Yes. As such, you
may call me Saber.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.670
Oh, um, all right.
That's certainly a strange name.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.340
My name is Shirou Emiya.
Um, I guess what I'd like to ask you is...

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.820
I know. You aren't a typical
Master, are you?

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.920
Master?

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.660
But be that as it may,
you are still my Master.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.650
Now that our pact has been concluded,
I will never do anything to betray you.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.830
H-Hey, wait a minute!
My name isn't "Master," okay?!

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.830
I will call you "Shirou," then.
Yes, I prefer the sound of that.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.260
Ow!

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.240
Wha...?

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.210
Shirou, treat my wound.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.270
Are you seriously
asking me?

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.550
Sorry, but I don't know how to do
any complicated magic like that.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.520
Besides, it looks like that wound
of yours has already healed.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.860
In that case, I deal with them
in my current condition.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.920
My regeneration has only covered
the outermost part.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.850
But it shouldn't hinder me
in one more fight.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.130
Hey, wait a minute!

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.000
Archer! Disappear!

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.320
Stop it, Saber!

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.930
She is the Master of an Archer.
We must kill her while we have the chance.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.330
You keep going on about Masters and
whatever, but I don't understand a word of it!

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.030
I still don't know who
or what you are.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.570
But if you explain it to me,
I'll hear you out, so stop this!

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.780
And what might
"this" be?

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.090
I will not obey such commands.
Enemies are to be slain.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.420
Girls shouldn't be waving weapons around!
That goes double for wounded girls!

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.550
So, when are you going
to lower your sword?

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.760
My sword will never be lowered when there
is an enemy still standing before me.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.370
Oh, so a Servant, a Saber at that, is saying
that she'll disobey her Master, huh?

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.670
Hey, you're...

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:52.840
Tohsaka?

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.780
Good evening, Emiya.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.320
Well, I expect that you're capable
of at least that much, Emiya.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:10.060
Wow, that's amazing!
I can't do anything like that...

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.430
Are you kidding? This is the basics of the
basics, no matter what style you study.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.300
I was only taught by my dad, so I don't
know the fundamentals or the basics.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.540
So you don't even know how to manipulate
the five elements or create a path?

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.680
No.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.180
So you're a
complete novice?

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.770
Well, I can do
reinforcement spells.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.580
That's some seriously
strange magic you use.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.320
You're saying you can't
do anything else at all?

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.190
I don't think so.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.820
How could a guy like this
manage to summon a Saber?

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.220
I'm guessing that you have no idea
the situation you're in, do you?

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.830
Situation?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.560
You've been dragged
into a certain game.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.660
A battle royale between seven Masters
called the Holy Grail Wars.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.940
Holy Grail Wars?
Battle royale?

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:02.180
You've been selected as a Master, Emiya.
You have a stigma on one of your hands, right?

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.850
Those are your three Command Seals.
It's the mark of a Master.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.720
Once every few decades,
seven Masters are selected.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:16.420
Each Master is granted a Servant,
and a battle to win the Holy Grail is held.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.730
I was chosen to be
a Master, too.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.270
As long as you have the Command Seals,
your Servant will continue to obey you.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.700
The Command Seals give you the right
of absolute authority over them.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.470
That seal is what bends them
to your will,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.900
...even if it's something that goes
against the Servant's wishes.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:40.420
However, you lose one each time
you give a command, so stop at #2.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.220
Hey, wait a minute!
What are you talking about?!

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.920
It looks like you're still in
an incomplete state, too.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.660
It must be because you were summoned
by an apprentice Magus...

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.160
...who has no idea what's expected
of him as a Master.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.800
Yes. Shirou doesn't even have enough
magical power to materialize me.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.170
This makes both returning to my spirit state
and recovering magical force problematical.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.740
If I were your Master, it would be
a snap for you to do either one...

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.080
What, are you saying I'm
not fit to be her Master?

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.550
That's exactly what I'm saying!
You quack.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.720
Well, what say
we get going?

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.250
Go? Go where?

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.020
To pay a visit to the person
who oversees this battle.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.100
Come on, don't you have anything
better for her to wear?

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.570
Hey, don't look at me.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.140
She said that she wouldn't
take off her armor.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.820
This "overseer" is in here?

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.750
The Kotomine Church.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.380
Shirou. I will wait
out here.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.250
I accompanied you so that
I could protect you.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.590
If this church is your destination, I don't expect
that you will go any further past here.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.500
Tohsaka, what sort of person
is the priest here?

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.400
He's my legal guardian.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:13.040
Also, as a Magus, he's my elder fellow pupil,
and you might even call him my second teacher.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:14.980
Magus?

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.980
A church's priest is also a member
of a heretical Council of Mages?

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.420
That's why he's such a pain
to put up with.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.710
His name is Kirei Kotomine.
He was a pupil of my father's.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.220
We've been forced to put up with
each other for ten years.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.520
If I had my way, I never would have
met him in the first place.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.960
I, too, had no desire to have a pupil who fails
to show her teacher the proper respect.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.070
I've brought the seventh
Master to see you.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.780
He's technically a Magus,
but he's a complete novice.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.280
I couldn't stand by
and watch.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.880
And what might your
name be, my son?

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.680
Shirou Emiya.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.820
Shirou Emiya?

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.860
And you are certain that you
are the Saber's Master?

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.830
You've got it all wrong.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.220
All this stuff about masters and holy Grail
Wars, I don't understand a word of it.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.930
This is a serious problem.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.040
Very well. This is the first time that Rin
has ever asked for my help.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.300
For that, Shirou Emiya, I will
never be able to repay you.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:24.040
Listen. Being a Master isn't something
that can be handed over to another.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.080
And once you have become one,
neither can you simply quit.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.980
The Command Seals you bear
are also a stigmata.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.620
The role of Master is a trial
that is bestowed upon one.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.450
One cannot simply walk away from it
simply because it is inconvenient.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.060
If you truly wish to give up
your status as Master,

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.300
...your only option is to obtain the Holy Grail
and make your wish come true.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.300
Make my wish
come true?

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.730
If you acquire the Grail,
any wish can be yours,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.680
...even cleaning any tarnish your soul
may have acquired in the process.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.550
Indeed, it is even possible to go back
and start all over from the beginning.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.250
So you should make
your wish.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:07.090
And should the time come, thank your lucky
stars that you were chosen as a Master.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:13.290
If you wish to erase those invisible burns that
you carry, simply accept your stigmata.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.530
Kirei, would you please
get to the point?

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.000
I asked you to explain
the rules to him.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.670
I'll cut to the
chase, then.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.240
This battle is called
the Holy Grail War,

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:30.080
...and it is a contest between
seven Masters using their Servants.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:34.450
We do not engage in this barbarity
because we wish to.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.290
It is all part of a rite to determine who
is worthy to possess the Holy Grail.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.750
You can't be serious...
The Holy Grail? The one from the legends?

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.160
The Holy Grail that appears in this city
is indeed the genuine article.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:49.700
As proof, we may look to the astonishing
miracles that happen here,

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.200
...one of which
is the Servants.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:57.410
Servants are entities that are something which
approaches the level of High Spirits.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.480
They are historical figures, or those
who are now heroes of legend,

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.570
...who have been given physical form
by the Holy Grail.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.850
In principle, they are always at their
Master's side in spirit form,

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.220
...but they can be made to materialize
and fight when the need arises.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.660
Your Saber is different,
though, Emiya.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.760
Her master is a screwup,
so she can't take spirit form.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:23.330
This miracle that is very nearly the resurrection
of the dead could rightly be called magic.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.600
If the Holy Grail possesses such power, surely
it bestows limitless power upon its holder.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:34.050
In the face of such facts, the question
of its authenticity is rendered moot.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.980
All right, I'll assume for now that
the Holy Grail really exists.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:43.590
But I don't see why you have to kill over it. If it's
that powerful, why doesn't everyone share it?

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.090
A sensible position to take. However, we
do not have the luxury of that choice.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.760
The Holy Grail selects those humans
who are most worthy to possess it,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.060
...and determines its one owner by having
those potential owners compete for it.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.270
The selection of the seven Masters,
the summoning of the Servants,

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.610
All of this is carried out
by the Grail itself.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.940
These are the Holy Grail Wars,
a time-honored rite...

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.210
...in which people are chosen by the Grail
and kill each other to attain it.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.390
Even if only one can be chosen, that doesn't
mean you have to kill the other Masters.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:22.720
Hold it. There's no rule saying that the
Masters absolutely have to kill each other.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.160
The Holy Grail is a
spiritual object.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.430
Only Servants, who are also spirits,
can touch it.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:36.410
The point of the Holy Grail Wars is to
eliminate all Servants but your own.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.140
Eliminate all Servants
but your own...

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.450
Oh, I get it! If your Servant
is the only one left,

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.380
...it would be the only one
that could touch the Grail.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.880
Right. So if you defeat their Servant,
there's no need to kill the Master, too.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.560
Geez, you could have told me that
in the first place!

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.620
So even if you fight in the Holy Grail Wars,
that doesn't mean that you'll die, Tohsaka?

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:05.070
Let me ask you something. Do you think
you could defeat your own Servant?

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.170
Servants are
immensely powerful.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:13.840
Even other Servants have trouble defeating
them, so their Masters go without saying.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:18.940
But a Servant cannot exist
without a Master. In which case...

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:23.850
It means that the most efficient way
to defeat a Servant is to kill its Master.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:28.820
Yes, but a Servant that's lost its Master
doesn't simply disappear immediately.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.360
A different Master can use his
Command Seals to forge a new pact.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:37.170
A Master who's lost his Servant and
a Servant who's lost its Master...

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:40.970
...can make a new pact
and rejoin the battle.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.840
So, what happens if you use up
your Command Seals?

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:50.410
Wouldn't that set your Servant free, and it
could make a pact with a different Master?

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.050
That's exactly right.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:57.420
If you use up your Command Seals, you will
be freed from your duties as Master.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:05.160
Of course, if there were such a Magus, it would
mark him as incompetent. No, a mere fool.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.700
If that should happen to you,
I guarantee you your safety.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:17.370
That is my duty as overseer of
this series of Holy Grail Wars.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:22.170
This is the fifth Holy Grail War that
has been held here in this city.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.280
The last one was
ten years ago.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.650
Have you people lost your minds?! You're
telling me that you've done this four times?!

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.450
The Holy Grail Wars of the past
had grown altogether too brutal.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.390
The Masters were driven on
by their desires,

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.760
...and simply butchered one
another indiscriminately.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.430
Because of that,
the Council of Mages...

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.510
...dispatched an overseer beginning
with the third War.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.580
That man was
my father.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:53.410
And I have inherited
that post from him.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:59.520
I guess the Holy Grail Wars
bring out the worst in people.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.920
I mean, those earlier Masters were type of
people who broke the rules of the Magi, right?

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.990
What would happen if people like that got the
Holy Grail and used it out of self-interest?

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:15.600
It would be a disaster if a guy who doesn't think
twice about killing others got the Grail, right?

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.840
The Council of Mages
does not interfere,

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:21.500
...regardless of the personality of
those who try to win the Grail.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:25.740
We only watch over the wars to ensure that the
rules of the Holy Grail Wars are being kept.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.840
If you take issue with that,
then survive the contest.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.790
Surely that is the most effective way,
not relying on others.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.510
Mind your own business!

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:41.230
I don't have any reason to fight, and I'm
not interested in this Grail of yours.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.860
So in that case, you're also not interested
in the calamities that might be caused...

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.670
...by the person who wins
the Grail, I take it?

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:54.100
You're not the least bit concerned with certain
events that transpired ten years ago, then?

00:18:55.380 --> 00:19:00.340
At the end of the last Grail War, the Grail
was touched by someone unworthy.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.310
We don't know what this
Master was hoping for.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:09.750
All we can be sure of are the scars
left behind by that disaster.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:16.390
Correct. That conflagration whose cause
is listed as unknown to this very day...

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.120
...is the scar left by
the Holy Grail Wars.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.260
Emiya, is something
the matter?

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.430
No, I'm all right.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.810
So, what was the outcome
of the last war?

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.340
There wasn't one.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:34.780
I told you, didn't I? The Grail
was touched by someone unworthy.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:39.540
Another man touched it before
the war reached its conclusion.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:46.010
But that man had avoided fighting,
and the Grail did not completely appear.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.190
When the seven Servants
gather together,

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.560
...the Grail will appear on its own
when the time comes.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:58.800
However, the Grail didn't acknowledge this
man who avoided fighting as its owner.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.340
In other words,
trying to get the Grail...

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.070
...without dealing with the
other Masters first is pointless.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:10.950
That guy who tried to get to the Grail first
the last time was a sentimental sap.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.820
Wait, don't tell me that this Master
you're talking about was you...

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.680
Only until partway
through the battle.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:23.460
I lost my Servant, and was taken under
the protection of the overseer, my father.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.890
That is all I will say
on the subject.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:32.540
Only a Master who commands a Servant
is qualified to win the Grail.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.180
When you seven are reduced
to the final participant,

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:39.070
...the Grail will appear
to the victor.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.940
I ask you again.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.220
Shirou Emiya, do you or do you not
intend to participate...

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.790
...in this Holy Grail War as
one of the chosen Masters?

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.630
I'll fight.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.530
If you're saying that it was the Holy Grail
Wars that caused that fire ten years ago,

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:06.040
...I can't let anything like that
happen again.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.970
That settles it, then.
Come on, let's go.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.180
Rejoice, my son! Your dreams
will finally come true.

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:20.750
Without clear-cut evil,
your wish will not come true.

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:28.020
Even if you do not wish to admit it,
virtue must have vice to fight against.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:36.490
To you, the loftiest dreams and the most
vile desires have the same meaning.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.700
Oh, there is no point in
trying to gloss over it.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.970
That conflict is completely
appropriate for a human.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.080
I've fulfilled my obligation
to you.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.010
You're a good person,
Tohsaka.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.910
Huh? Flattering me won't
make me go easy on you.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.420
Shirou!

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.860
Good evening, mister.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.530
This is the second time we've
met like this, isn't it?

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:24.310
In the deep, dark forest, as I search
for the faint fragrance...

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:36.730
...of the lingering traces of the days
I held dear, I suddenly hear you laugh.

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:49.530
I reach out to try to touch you, but your
image fluttered fleetingly in midair.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:59.710
I've missed you for so long,
I've longed for you for so long.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:04.120
Wandering through
sleepless nights,

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:19.940
...I am crying, enveloped within the
light and shadow you left behind,

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:31.710
...here in the deep,
dark forest.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:45.300
Next Time

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.230
Fate Stay Night.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:05.720
Next time,
"The Strongest Enemy."

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.750
Next Time:
The Strongest Enemy
Next time,
"The Strongest Enemy."

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.690
Next Time:
The Strongest Enemy
