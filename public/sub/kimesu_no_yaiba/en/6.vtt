00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.820
DESTROY

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.570
Have you gotten changed?

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.690
Yes.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.980
EPISODE 6:
SWORDSMAN ACCOMPANYING A DEMON

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.020
Tanjiro...

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.030
Now that you're starting out
with the Demon Slayer Corps,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.780
I'd like to explain a few things to you.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.240
Right.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.410
That Demon Slayer Corps outfit
you're wearing right now...

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.620
It's made of a special kind of fiber.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.630
The fabric is quite breathable,
yet it repels moisture and won't burn easily.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.630
A low-level demon's talons or fangs
couldn't even manage to tear that uniform.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.090
It's that strong?

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.890
Also,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.600
that Nichirin Sword of yours...

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.140
The color varies from owner to owner,
and each hue has unique properties.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.940
But since not many people end up with
black blades, little is known about them.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.150
So little, in fact, that—

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.700
So little is known that...
What, Mr. Urokodaki?

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.200
Since so little is known about them,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.500
black blades are said to be wielded
by swordsmen who'll never go far.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.290
I don't know how I'll do
in the Demon Slayer Corps,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.920
but I'm going to turn Nezuko
back into a human no matter what.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.640
Yes, you're right.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.760
I have faith
that you're going to make that happen.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.260
Right.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.140
One more thing.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.350
Take this.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.650
It's a box for you
to carry your sister in during the day.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.150
Built out of an extremely light wood
called "Cloud Mist Pine."

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.780
I coated it with rock lacquer
to reinforce its exterior

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.660
and to make it even more durable.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.910
Thank you very much!

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.580
It's so light!
It's really light, Mr. Urokodaki!

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.340
Nezuko!

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.260
Get inside this, will you?

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.220
Can you do it?

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.990
Nezuko, from now on,
we're always gonna be together, okay?

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.240
All right, I'll be going now.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.620
Hold on. Do you mind?

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.110
Nezuko, are you all right?

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.580
Nezuko?

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.540
I'm just guessing here,

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.750
but it could be that Nezuko's recovering
her strength by sleeping

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.800
instead of consuming human flesh.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.390
Nezuko...

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.770
You get lots of rest.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.750
Could this be the town to the northwest?

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.860
Oh, look, there's Kazumi.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.110
Poor thing. He looks so haggard.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.160
Because he was with Satoko
when she was taken.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.170
Night after night... It's so creepy.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.340
It's so dreadful!

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.890
When night falls,
yet another young girl will be abducted!

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.350
Mr. Kazumi!

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.480
If you don't mind,
I'd like to hear your story.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.150
Is that all right?

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.290
This is where Satoko vanished.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.660
You may not believe me.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.170
I do believe you!

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.420
I believe you, all right!

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.250
I believe you!

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.350
There's still a faint trace of demon scent,

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.230
but it's uneven, so to speak.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.360
There's something strange about this.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.490
Who is this kid anyway?

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.370
How dare you!

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:05.960
What do you mean, "vanished"?

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.500
You bastard!

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.710
Dear!

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.460
That's enough! Please stop!

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.270
I want you to believe me.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.100
She really did vanish.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.440
I believe you.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.780
After all, that's why I'm here.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.780
You're gonna keep going?

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.490
Yes.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.910
Look how late it's gotten.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.370
I'm flattered
that you're so concerned for me,

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.630
but shouldn't you pick up
again tomorrow and get some rest?

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.550
Those things are active during the night.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.680
So, I can't afford to rest.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.640
I've detected a new scent in this area.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.810
It's gotta be somewhere nearby.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.270
Those things...

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.360
Don't tell me you're...

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:51.980
You're seriously...

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.240
How terrifying.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.160
I want you to stay indoors
for the time being.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:06.910
Yes, Mother.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
Now then, good night.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.950
I wonder what became of the girls
who were taken.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.540
I just hope they're all right.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.700
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.160
So fast!

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.670
The scent just got stronger!

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.540
The demon's at large!

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.630
He jumped?

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.260
He spoke of demons.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.260
The Demon Slayer Corps...

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.930
He really...

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.020
This is it.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.400
They're here right now!

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.870
Two different scents.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.950
A demon and a female human!

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.870
They're nowhere to be seen.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.090
But...

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.930
The spot where the scent is strongest...

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.510
is right here!

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.040
A morphed demon!

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.500
The demons who use a special spell
called the "Blood Demon Art"

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.010
possess supernatural abilities.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.680
You may have to fight those demons,
as well, from now on.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.600
Where are those girls you kidnapped?

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.310
I've got two more questions for you!

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.450
Who was that?

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:13.660
Mr. Kazumi,

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.710
Please hold this person and stand nearby.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.790
If you're inside my range of attack,
I can protect you!

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.920
From the ground or this wall...

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.380
It can probably emerge from anywhere.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.600
There's also the chance
that it could show up out of thin air.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:37.730
But this demon...

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.650
Even when it's submerged,
it can't erase its scent!

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:46.900
Here it comes!

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:48.860
Water Breathing,

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.200
Fifth Form!

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:55.910
There's three of them!

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.580
Settle down!

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.330
You can do it!

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.300
Eighth Form...

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.720
Waterfall Basin!

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.970
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.980
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.070
Tanjiro, listen to me closely.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:31.410
The type of demon with the blood
that can turn humans into demons...

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.870
There's only one in this world.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.990
Just one...

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.540
The one who was the first
to become a demon

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.170
more than a thousand years ago.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.880
In other words,
that is your family's foe.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.920
Moreover, I believe he's the one...

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:53.470
who might know how to turn
your sister back into a human.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.890
That demon's name is...

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.270
...Muzan Kibutsuji!

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:06.940
Eighth Form,

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.190
Waterfall Basin!

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.070
Too shallow!

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.950
I missed all the vulnerable spots!

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.870
Because I switched forms
midway through!

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.460
All three of them
have the exact same scent.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.010
I was told that demons
don't band together as a rule.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.680
So, one demon has dispersed
into three.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.850
I'm going to protect these two
while slashing those three demons!

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.480
Don't lose your nerve!

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.270
Make sure you get him to tell you...

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.610
about Muzan Kibutsuji...

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.360
and how to turn a demon
back into a human!

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.490
Total Concentration...

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.030
Water Breathing...

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.740
Second Form...

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.410
Water Wheel!

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.960
Too shallow again!

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.340
I can't chase him too far.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.600
And I can't take a full swing
while guarding others!

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.270
You bastard!

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.190
Back off for crying out loud!

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.360
That girl's gonna go stale on me, dammit!

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.030
That girl's already 16, okay?

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.940
If I don't devour her soon,

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.030
she's gonna lose flavor
by the second!

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.660
Calm down, my other self.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.620
Hey, so what?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
There are gonna be nights like this.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.420
I've already fed on plenty
of 16-year-old girls in this town.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.800
They were all quite meaty and delicious.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.010
I'm satisfied.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.180
Well, I'm not satisfied, my other self!

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.930
I wanna consume more!

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:06.940
You monster...

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.270
Return Satoko to me.
The one you abducted the night before last!

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.620
Satoko?

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.290
Who are you talking about?

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:32.550
If her hairpin
is among these collectibles,

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:34.550
then I've devoured her.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.930
I missed again!

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.090
He can escape underground so fast!

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.850
Oh no! I got too close to the wall!

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.490
Why would a mere human
be accompanying a demon?

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.830
What's the meaning of this?
Who are those two?

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:57.090
Are they a swordsman
and demon working together?

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.180
I don't get it at all.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.310
Nezuko...

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.530
This may only be cold comfort,

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.280
but while Nezuko was asleep,

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.780
I used hypnotic suggestion on her.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.200
Suggestion?

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.290
"All humans are your family."

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.040
"Protect humans."

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.540
"The demons are the enemy"!

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.630
Nezuko!

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.390
"Never forgive any demon

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.800
who brings harm onto humans"!

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:23.960
PREVIEW

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:23.960
RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.070
Your kicks really saved the day, Nezuko!

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.320
Thanks!

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.990
It didn't break even after
all those kicks from the inside.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.990
That box is super-strong!

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.620
But isn't it cramped in there?
Isn't it uncomfortable?

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:22.250
I'll build a much bigger box for you!

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.840
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:33.300
I heard today's demon has been grinding
his teeth like crazy since he was a human.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.520
Next, Episode 7, "Muzan Kibutsuji"!

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.020
TO BE CONTINUED
