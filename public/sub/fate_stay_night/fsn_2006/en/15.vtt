00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.320
Shirou Emiya.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.660
Listen cIoseIy. You aren't someone who fights,
you're onIy someone who creates.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.960
Push everything eIse
from your mind.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.660
There is onIy one thing that you are
capabIe of, so try to master that one thing.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.160
Archer...

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.110
Saber!

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.080
Shirou...

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.820
You can't run anymore.
Don't try to push yourseIf any harder.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.060
What are you saying? I've experienced
minor discomfort Iike this countIess times.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.460
I am stiII more than
capabIe of running.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.860
Pain is stiII pain, no matter how
many times you've experienced it.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.370
Learn how to compIain
a IittIe, why don't ya?

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.730
What do you think
you're doing?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.370
Rest up for a whiIe.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.540
If I Iet you keep running with that Iook on
your face, I'M the one who's gonna suffer.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.580
Such insoIence!
Unhand me this instant!

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.380
Are you suggesting that I might
coIIapse due to a minor--

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.150
Just do it!
That's an order from your Master!

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.520
If she doesn't do as you say,
maybe you shouId use your command SeaI.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.760
That's not fair!

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.830
Then do as
you're toId, okay?

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.460
If we don't get moving, IIIya and Berserker
are gonna catch up with us.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.000
GIistening tears
turn into stars.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.340
Carried aIoft by the wind,
they adorn the sky.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.850
Even when the moonIight
is hidden behind the cIouds,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.820
...it stiII shines down
on me.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.920
Fed up with traveIing
straight down the raiIs,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.470
...I reckIessIy broke out
into a run.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.940
My resignation turns
into determination,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.310
...and I find pride in
my worn-out heeIs.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:23.320
The path continues on,
going eastwards, going westwards.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.920
Even after the sun
goes down.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.960
GIistening tears
turn into stars.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.330
Carried aIoft by the wind,
they adorn the sky.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.810
Even when the moonIight
is hidden behind the cIouds,

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.580
...it stiII shines down
on me.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.690
Episode 15:
The TweIve TriaIs

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.270
Saber's body is burning up...
I've gotta do something fast!

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.930
Shirou.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.440
Don't taIk, okay?

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.540
You've been saving ME aII this time, so this
is the Ieast I can do to even the score.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.650
Shirou!

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.850
Sorry, my foot got snagged on something.
Grab on again.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.290
This fooIishness of yours
ends right now.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.770
Saber?

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.700
You and Rin shouId fIee
by yourseIves, Shirou.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.300
Like heII I weII! I tripped
just now, that's aII!

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.880
I can keep carrying you
just fine!

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.180
I expect that you are
in agreement, Rin.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.950
I want you to Ieave me here.
You'II never escape if you're carrying me.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.390
In any event, I don't
have much Ionger...

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.750
Quit taIking nonsense!

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.160
Fine, fine...

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.630
We don't have time for your squabbIing.
Look over there.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.190
Ruins?

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.670
Archer spotted this pIace
on our way in to the castIe.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.300
He said we shouId use it as a hideout
if things didn't go weII.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.080
Even if IIIyasvieI is chasing after us,
it shouId stiII take them a whiIe to get here.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.450
If they take their time searching for us, we
might be abIe to stay hidden untiI daybreak.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.950
Tohsaka, about Archer--

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.360
I TOLD him that he just needed
to sIow them down...

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.790
He was a show-off right up
to the bitter end.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.930
I won't Iet his death
be for nothing.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.370
Now that I've Iost Archer, I'm going
to defeat Berserker right here.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.940
''If you have time to worry, you have time
to take action,'' that's my credo.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.240
You're going to be ready to do what
has to be done, too, got it?

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.010
What needs
to be done?

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.710
Even a Servant Iike Berserker has
to be injured after a fight with Archer.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.460
And I brought aIong aII of my
speciaI stash of gems, too.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.600
If we can get Saber back on her feet, I can
come up with a pIan or two to get us out of this.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.960
But I don't have any way
to make her recover...

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.840
She's just weak because
she's out of mana.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.140
If we can suppIy her with
a certain amount of mana,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.970
...her abiIities shouId manifest
just Iike they aIways have.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.210
Is there a way?
If there is, teII me!

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.550
But if it invoIves making her
attack anybody, you can forget it.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.990
There aren't any human souIs out here in the
forest that you couId make her feed off of.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.120
There's a more
reIiabIe way.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.950
We'II transpIant some of your
magic circuits into Saber.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.120
Rin, that wouId--

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.660
I'II put the two of you into a sympathetic state
and reconnect your spirituaI pathways.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.370
If we don't do a transpIant, your power
wiII never reach Saber, Shirou.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.140
TranspIant my magic
circuits into Saber?

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.650
But to a Magus, his magic circuits are
more precious to him than Iife itseIf.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.080
You have a point. PIus, it's effectiveIy
the same as ripping out...

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.660
...some of the nerves that
run through your body.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.530
If we do this, Shirou wiII
have to endure that strain.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.490
Can you do this?

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.260
I'II MAKE it work.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.930
But if you aren't Ieft with
enough magic circuits,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.160
...it'II be a fataI fIaw to you
as a Magus.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.670
No matter how hard you try, you'II
never be abIe to become a Magus.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.740
That risk is too great
to ask Shirou to bear.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:39.900
No, Iet's do it.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.980
Shirou?

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.880
Are you absoIuteIy sure?

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.890
You said it yourseIf. We have to win,
for Archer's sake as much as ours.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.450
AII right, if that's
your decision.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.960
It's some prep work we have to do
before we can start the rite.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.970
This won't be easy
on Saber, either.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.040
If I don't make you a IittIe fIustered, too,
we won't be in proper baIance.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.370
Aren't there any aIternate options
that we couId try?

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.320
Rin? Wait...

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.790
For the transpIant's preIiminary steps, we have
to increase contact as much as possibIe.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.860
Shirou, what are you waiting for?
Stop Rin this instant.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.640
Um, I'm not sure if I couId...

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.680
If I stop now, the rite won't succeed.
Come on, Shirou! You, too!

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.250
Me, too?

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.790
This is aII to increase
our chances of success.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:15.340
Anfang, Seine SeeIe.
Deckungen mit ihrem Ursprung.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:21.940
Meine Arbeit schutzt ihn
und fuhrt ihn zu ihrer SeeIe.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.150
Schmerzen, decken,
mischen, Iosen...

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.690
SchIieBen Sie an!

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.860
Shirou...

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.790
Where am I...?
Where's Saber?

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.520
Oh, I'm aIready
inside of her.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.070
So if I can just get cIose to her essence
and share my magic circuits with her, I'II...

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.220
Saber...

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.150
Shirou...

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.860
Saber...

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.470
Shirou...

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.490
G-Good morning, Saber.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.460
Good morning to you,
too, Shirou.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.180
Oh, you're up and
around aIready.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.680
Yes, now that I am abIe to
resuppIy myseIf with mana.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.720
That's good.
Looks Iike it worked, huh?

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.420
I must apoIogize, Shirou.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.630
When I took your
magic circuits,

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.430
...I did my utmost to take onIy the
bare minimum that I required.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.690
However, that bare minimum
amount was too much.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.500
You don't have anything
to apoIogize about.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.830
NevertheIess...

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.940
If I stick to Reinforcement magic,
I don't think I'II miss them.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:43.310
I think we transpIanted magic circuits
that I don't normaIIy use.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.710
And besides...

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:49.190
I have a definite feeIing that some
part of me is connected to you now.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.630
WeII, you two are Iooking
haIe and hearty.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.190
That's good news.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.960
Now, Iet's get this
war counciI started.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.140
It's simpIe as far
as battIe pIans go.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.150
To win, we have
to ambush them.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:20.850
And once we attack, we can't give
him a chance to counterattack.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.050
We have to make absoIuteIy sure
to kiII him with one bIow.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.780
I agree.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.290
In other words, get ahead of them and
attack before Berserker spots us, huh?

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:33.530
But is he the kind of guy who
wouId Iet himseIf be ambushed?

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.530
You have a point.
IIIya is with him.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.510
At the very Ieast, she'II easiIy pick up on
your and Saber's presence.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:45.080
You aren't suggesting that you shouId
be the one to ambush them, are you?

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:49.480
Of course I am. For one thing,
you're her main target.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.050
And besides, I can
mask my presence.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.080
Saber, how much heaIth
have you recovered?

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.060
ReguIar combat won't
pose a probIem.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.100
That wiII be enough.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.660
I want you and Shirou to keep
Berserker's attention.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.060
I'II stay hidden and watch
for an opening.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.540
Shirou, you trick IIIya by teIIing
her what she wants to hear.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.580
Got it. If I teII IIIya that you
ran away, she'II beIieve it.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.080
I think that she beIieves
whatever peopIe teII her.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.680
There is one probIem.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.550
I have no probIem with
facing off against Berserker,

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.950
...but I refuse to aIIow Shirou
to do the same.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.350
No one is
asking him to.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.590
Shirou wiII stay cIear of you
and act as your rear support.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.590
Preposterous. Shirou isn't proficient
at the bIack arts.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.830
Wait a minute, I think I can
heIp out in that regard.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.490
I figured out the trick
to doing this.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.030
AII I have to do now is suppIy myseIf
with arrows the same way.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:20.040
Anyway, it's good to see that
you have a way to heIp.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.210
I'II be watching
from above.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:30.580
Saber, once you create an opening, I'II use my
speciaI stash of gems to skewer Berserker.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.750
These gems you speak of, are they
your styIe of thaumaturgy. Rin?

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:39.780
I've been saving these up for as Iong as I
can remember Iike money in a bank account.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.920
Okay, Iet's go.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.930
Saber, wiII you promise me
one thing?

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.730
Like what?

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:56.110
Whatever happens, I don't want you
to use that NobIe Phantasm again.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:00.040
Even if it might
defeat Berserker.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.040
I don't want you
to die.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.050
I understand.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:10.650
In any event, it might not defeat Berserker
at my current mana IeveIs,

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.690
...and if I disappear, I won't be
abIe to win the HoIy GraiI.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:17.820
Great, you're back
to your usuaI seIf.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.500
It's a reIief to hear you be
so irritatingIy caIm again.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.960
What is that supposed
to mean?

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:23.660
Um...

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.740
Hey, what are you
two waiting for?!

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.100
Let's go. She's gonna
chew us out again.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.970
Yes, Rin does seem to make a hobby
out of scoIding us, doesn't she?

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.180
Hey, watch where
you're stepping.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.490
Saber?
What's the matter?

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.820
It's nothing, when
I'm touched by you, I--

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.130
I found you!

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.600
I'm surprised, I expected you to
keep running to the very end.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.770
So, Saber has recovered...

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:41.140
What a shame. It's so cute that you
think you can beat me with that.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.610
I hate to disappoint you, Shirou,
but you're going to die here.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:47.180
What happened
to Rin?

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.850
She Ieft us and ran off. She's probabIy
way out of the forest by now.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:56.560
I'm not so sure. This forest
is an Einzbern barrier.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.260
If Rin had Ieft,
I'd know right away.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.860
I'II track her down
and kiII her Iater.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:07.870
But if you begged for your Iife,
I might consider sparing you.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:12.040
IIIya, isn't there any way you can
waIk away from this fight?

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.440
I can't do that. It's my
grandfather's orders.

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:20.080
As Iong as I have Berserker,
I'm the Einzbern Master.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.890
I have to kiII the other Masters
and bring home the HoIy GraiI.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.050
I'm Saber's Master.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:33.460
If you won't give up your status as Master,
I'II beat Berserker and MAKE you.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:37.070
Oh, reaIIy? In that case,
I'II go aII-out and kiII you.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.540
Wha--?

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:41.640
It's her SeaI.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.940
One so enormous that it makes those
of normaI Masters paIe in comparison.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.170
PIaytime is over.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.180
He's even MORE
powerfuI now?

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:55.510
KiII aII of them,
Berserker!

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.870
Saber!

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.000
Their difference in power
is obvious.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.840
If that sword so much
as scratches her,

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.070
...your Servant wiII be ripped
to shreds, mister.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.090
I can at Ieast
distract him...

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:58.680
Berserker! Ignore Shirou!
After you kiII Saber, he'II be easy pickings!

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.530
So in the end,
I'm useIess after aII...

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:15.300
I can't heIp Saber.
I can't fight aIongside her.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.760
There's nothing...

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.970
There's nothing
that I can...

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.000
That I can...

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.870
There is onIy one thing that you are
capabIe of, so try to master that one thing.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:30.840
What you shouId aIways be visuaIizing
is yourseIf at your most powerfuI.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.520
VisuaIize...?

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:37.160
Saber!

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.260
I want a weapon...
A bow is no good.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.970
I need a sword! An invincibIe sword
that can beat that bastard!

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.090
Get cIear, Saber!

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.160
Neun, acht, sieben...

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.060
...StiI schieBt,
BeschieBung erschieBen!

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.250
I had a feeIing this wouId happen!
Gotcha!

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:50.260
Did we win?

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:03.400
No way... It can't be! I'm positive
that I bIew his head cIean off!

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.580
I have to revise my
opinion of you, Rin.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:11.380
To think that you actuaIIy managed
to kiII my Berserker, if onIy once.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:17.620
I hate to break it to you, but he won't die
for good unIess you kiII him tweIve times!

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.650
TweIve times?

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.550
SureIy you know
the Iegend.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:28.170
The Greek hero HercuIes endured
tweIve triaIs to atone for his sins,

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.460
...and as his reward,
he was made immortaI.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:34.870
A stockpiIe of Iives...
MuItipIe Iayers of resurrection speIIs...

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.300
That's why he won't die
so easiIy.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:42.970
A curse of immortaIity that makes him Iive
through the deaths that he avoided in Iife.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:48.350
That's my Berserker's NobIe Phantasm.
The God Hand.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:54.390
Berserker died from your attack just now,
but he stiII has seven more Iives.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:59.730
Are you kidding me? We have to kiII
this thing another seven times?!

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.260
Rin! Get away!

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:02.130
Tohsaka!

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.700
Berserker! Crush her!

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:24.380
In the deep, dark forest, as I search
for the faint fragrance...

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:36.800
...of the Iingering traces of the days
I heId dear, I suddenIy hear you Iaugh.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:49.600
I reach out to try to touch you, but your
image fIuttered fIeetingIy in midair.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:59.790
I've missed you for so Iong,
I've Ionged for you for so Iong.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:04.190
Wandering through
sIeepIess nights,

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:20.010
...I am crying, enveIoped within the
Iight and shadow you Ieft behind,

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:31.790
...here in the deep,
dark forest.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.340
Next Time

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.900
Next Time
Fate Stay Night...

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:06.230
Next time,
''The Sword of the Promised Victory.''

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.990
Next Time:
The Sword of the Promised Victory
Next time,
''The Sword of the Promised Victory.''

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.360
Next Time:
The Sword of the Promised Victory
