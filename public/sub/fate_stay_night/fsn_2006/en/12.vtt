00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.860
You're the one who's
behind this, Shinji?!

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.990
Come to me, Saber!

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.490
Shinji!

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.270
Turn off the barrier,
Shinji!

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.170
Get reaI! Why shouId
I do what you say?

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.640
Shirou!

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.550
Everything... Everything...
Everything... Everything...

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.600
Everything... Everything...
Everything...

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.260
Smash everything...

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.830
Destroy it aII!

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:23.760
Yume ni mite ita, ano hi no kage ni
todokanai sakebi.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:37.070
Asu no jibun wa nante egaite mo
kienai negai ga nureru.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:50.060
Koboreochiru kakera o
tsukamu sono te de...

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:04.770
...yureru kokoro kakaete
tobikonde ike yoru e!

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:16.550
Dare ka no tami ni ikite
kono toki ga subete de ii deshou?

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:28.530
Misekake no jibun wa sotto sutete
tada ari no mama de.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.300
Episode 12:
SpIitting the Sky

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.110
Oh, reaIIy? It was just a
case of exhaustion, huh?

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.980
Oh, is that right?
That sounds Iike Fuji-nee, aII right.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.580
No, that's normaI
for her.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.360
Right. PIease teII her
that I said heIIo.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.760
Okay. Bye.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.830
How is Taiga?

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.330
They say she's asking for second
heIpings of food at the hospitaI.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.940
More, pIease!

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.840
I want to go pay her a visit, but there's
something that we have to do first.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.080
It isn't absoIuteIy necessary that
we capture Rider's Master today.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.510
Saber...

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.450
If you insist on fighting, sureIy it can wait untiI
after your body has had a chance to heaI.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.580
That's not what
I meant, Saber.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.920
In terms of priorities, my heaIth
is way down on the Iist.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.190
We have to separate him from Rider before he
has a chance to set up another barrier Iike that.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.430
Are you saying that you wish to avoid
more victims Iike there were yesterday?

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.040
That is the reason you fight? You mean
it isn't simpIy to defeat Rider's Master?

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.240
No, I want to make Shinji answer
for what he did, aII right.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.310
Beating Rider is part
of doing that.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.680
Besides, it's onIy naturaI to take action to try
and prevent peopIe from being hurt, isn't it?

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.250
That's more important than
having a reason to fight.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.090
I see. If those are my Masters
wishes, I wiII obey.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.490
Saber!

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.090
So, I hear you're going
to Iook for Shinji.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.460
I assume that means that you have a good
chance of beating him, right, Shirou?

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.360
Beating him?
Shinji?

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.310
''I was about to move against another Master,
even though I have no chance of winning.''

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.470
If you teII me that, I'm going
to Iaugh in your face.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.540
If this were onIy a fight against Rider,
it wouId not present a probIem.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.780
Having faced Rider personaIIy,
I'm sure that Shirou can see it, too.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.520
Oh, he did?

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.050
Rider isn't as powerfuI
as Saber.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.460
In a one-on-one fight, I don't
see how she couId Iose.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.690
WeII, weII, you actuaIIy do stand
a good chance of winning.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.340
What's with the Iack
of enthusiasm, then?

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.840
Is there some other probIem that
you're not teIIing me about?

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.100
Here's the thing,
Tohsaka...

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.710
Rider was compIeteIy outcIassed by Saber
and driven into a corner by her,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.070
...but she stiII managed
to escape with Shinji.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.850
I think it was Rider's
NobIe Phantasm.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.590
So, she's a type that has a NobIe Phantasm
that's a much higher IeveI than she herseIf is.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.220
I was unabIe to verify it, but it seemed to be of
a simiIar category to the magic you use, Rin.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.140
That's strange. No modern magic couId
even come cIose to hurting you.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.640
True, one Mystery is rendered ineffective
in the face of a more powerfuI Mystery.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.980
The onIy Mysteries capabIe of piercing
my armor are what you caII ''miracIes''...

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.940
...and the Iegendary creatures
that dweII in the divine pIanes.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.450
A magic-user... Are you saying
that Rider is a Magus, Saber?

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.820
No, I didn't sense mana
of that magnitude.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.460
That NobIe Phantasm had no reIation
to Rider's personaI abiIities.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.590
It is most IikeIy not an anti-personneI NobIe
Phantasm such as my sword or Lancer's spear.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.960
Anti-personneI NobIe Phantasm?

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.700
When aII is said and done, my sword
is a weapon meant to kiII peopIe.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.170
No matter how powerfuI the mana
or speIIs pIaced upon it,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.970
...it wiII never be anything more
than an anti-personneI weapon.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.310
What was Rider's
NobIe Phantasm, then?

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.820
That must make it an
anti-army NobIe Phantasm.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.480
Those can be used equaIIy
against peopIe or bouIders.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.520
SimpIy put, an anti-personneI NobIe Phantasm
is a pistoI with unIimited ammunition,

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.490
...whiIe an anti-army NobIe Phantasm
is a missiIe that can be fired once.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.960
Hey, wait a minute! A gun
can't beat a missiIe!

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.290
Oh, I get it!

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.440
To fight Rider, we have to beat her before
she has a chance to use her NobIe Phantasm!

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.440
You get
a goId star!

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.740
The Ionger the fight is drawn out,
the more we're at a disadvantage.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.270
WeII, now that
that's settIed...

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.010
I'm sorry, but I can't sign on board
for your IittIe Shinji Search Squad.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.520
Tohsaka?

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.480
I have something of my own to take care of.
I'II be waiting to hear the good news.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.930
As we expected, he doesn't
appear to be here.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.070
Given his personaIity, the first thing on his mind
right now wiII be getting revenge against us.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.210
You beIieve that Rider's Master wiII
attempt to erect another barrier?

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.240
I'm sure of it.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.010
As big as that barrier is, we'II be
abIe to sense it if we get cIose.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.210
It isn't Shinji we shouId
be Iooking for--

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.980
But rather the barrier.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.820
I'm surprised.
That was good thinking, Shirou.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.520
Hey, I'm not a compIete idiot,
you know.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.960
Let's go. If Shinji's going to set up a barrier,
it won't be here, it'II be in New Town.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.500
Do you want to
go aIready, Shirou?

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.470
This is Sakura's home. Since we are here,
perhaps you shouId say heIIo?

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.800
No, I'd better not. I don't want to
get Sakura invoIved in this fight.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.460
Shirou? Is something
the matter?

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.010
Shirou.
Come with me.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:13.200
Hey, wait! There are stiII some buiIdings
that we haven't checked yet! Hey!

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.390
What's the matter with you?
There's nothing out here.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:22.820
You can see that,
can't you?

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.360
Do as you're toId
and sit down.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.650
Huh?

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.860
I see that your body has finaIIy
gotten your attention, Shirou.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.570
This is what happens if you push yourseIf too
hard when your injuries aren't fuIIy heaIed.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.860
Sorry... I'II be back on my feet in a bit,
so give me a few minutes.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.840
Nothing I say gets through
to you, does it?

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.580
If you do not care to rest aIone,
I wiII join you.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.890
Staying rested is part
of waging a battIe, too.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.390
Shirou, your coIor seems to be worse
than it was a moment ago.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.800
My coIor is fine!
I'm not fIustered at aII!

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.030
FIustered?

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.540
Forget it.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.310
It wouId be best if you Iaid down, but there
doesn't seem to be anywhere to--

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.280
Shirou. If you Iike,
rest your head here.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:36.530
Don't worry about it! I just need to
sit stiII for a whiIe, and I'II be fine.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:05.420
Did I faII asIeep?

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.360
Yes, for about
an hour.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.290
Why didn't you wake me up?!
We don't have time to rest!

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.330
Rest is a necessary action.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:22.000
WeII, I do feeI better, but I wish we couId've
picked somewhere eIse to rest up.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.240
Do you have some sort of
connection to this pIace?

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.250
Oh, right. I guess
I never toId you.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.020
A Iong time ago, I used
to Iive around here.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:39.080
There was a big fire, and I Iost
my parents and my home in it.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:43.530
That's when my dad saved my Iife,
and a whiIe after that, he adopted me.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.270
I hear that this pIace was a
battIeground in the Iast war.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:54.630
It's kinda ironic that I survived, onIy
to become a Master in this Iatest one.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:11:00.280
Shirou. Is that the reason that you
do not want anyone eIse to be hurt?

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.080
You yourseIf were injured as an innocent
bystander in the HoIy GraiI Wars,

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.610
...so you do not want anyone eIse
to go through the same thing?

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.950
Maybe it's something
simpIer than that.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:19.660
Ten years ago, when my dad
saved me, I was happy.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.670
But the fact that I was the onIy one whose
wish was granted didn't sit weII with me.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:31.070
Even though everyone eIse wanted to be saved,
I was the onIy one whose Iife was spared.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.140
That's why...

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.940
If I'm going to repay that debt
to the peopIe who died,

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.320
...I shouId at Ieast prevent
what's about to happen.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:47.590
If the same thing happened again, I'd never
be abIe to face those peopIe who died.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.430
You have no interest in preserving
your own Iife, do you?

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.500
You vaIue others more than you vaIue yourseIf.
That is a nobIe sentiment.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.860
But mark my words, you wiII
come to regret it one day.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.600
You ought to vaIue yourseIf
more highIy, Shirou.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.840
Let's go. Staying here is definiteIy
putting undue stress on you.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.370
We've compIeted our rounds
of the main buiIdings.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.770
Is there anywhere eIse
that we shouId go?

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.580
WeII, there's a factory
up ahead that--

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:42.740
Shirou!

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.840
I feIt it, too.
Is it cIose?

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.980
No, we aren't cIose enough
to the barrier yet.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.010
But we are definiteIy
being watched.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.320
This must be a chaIIenge
directed at us.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.720
I wiII foIIow the mana traiI.
Stay on your guard, Master.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.000
Saber, be carefuI.
Something isn't right.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.140
Yes, but--

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.010
Shirou!

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.390
Saber, it's--

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.030
I wiII go after her.
You wait here, Shirou!

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:47.010
Rider's heading towards the roof, huh?
Which means that her Master, Shinji, is--

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.930
It Iooks Iike you don't care
for high pIaces, Saber.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.030
That swordpIay you're
so proud of...

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.130
...is useIess here, see?

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.170
But you can
rest assured.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.320
Before too Iong, I'II put you
out of your misery.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.890
Damn! Why doesn't it go
aII the way to the roof?!

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.440
What?

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:30.010
A Mystery that's on par with a miracIe...
She has a Iegendary beast that's miIIennia oId?

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.460
Saber...

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:06.450
I'm surprised. You're far more
robust than you Iook.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.910
CaIIing up a creature from
the Age of the Gods...

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.450
That is a profoundIy
sinfuI act, Rider!

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.860
I am nothing more than someone
who was an enemy to your kind.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.460
So I ride onIy those poor creatures
that you peopIe drove to extinction.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.770
Now I see what you are. I had thought that
something about you didn't quite fit...

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.200
You're no Epic Hero, you're some
sort of demon, aren't you?

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.440
I suggest that you start
throwing curses,

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.070
...because you can't so much
as touch my friend here!

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:37.610
Shirou isn't up here.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.290
I wiII wait for the instant that
Rider becomes vuInerabIe.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.290
I need onIy focus on defense,
and hoId out untiI then...

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.950
Shirou...

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:53.230
Shirou!
Why are you here?!

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.530
Shinji!

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.270
Were you watching, Emiya?! This is the
difference between my power and yours!

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.130
Where are you,
Shinji?!

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.610
Both you and that Servant
of yours are finished!

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.040
But don't worry,
we're oId friends!

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.550
I'II grant you a quick death
so you won't suffer!

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:19.560
Do it, Rider! Start with that woman!
Tear her Iimb from Iimb!

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.290
Saber!

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.060
Saber!

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:29.200
Shirou...

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.900
Saber?

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.940
I suppose the pre-game show
is at an end, isn't it, Saber?

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:56.520
My NobIe Phantasm is powerfuI, so it
invariabIy attracts attention whenever it's used.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.430
But up here. I'm gIad that there's
no risk of being seen by anyone.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.660
That's your NobIe Phantasm,
Rider?

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.630
Yes. My friend here is too gentIe
to be suited for battIe.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.640
If I didn't use something Iike this,
he'd never feeI incIined to fight.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.580
Die, Saber!

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.690
Hear me, o wind...

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.040
That's--

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:15.100
Rider...

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:19.200
BeIIerophon!

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.550
You said that there wouId be
no risk of prying eyes up here.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.740
I am gratefuI, too!

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.680
Up here, I don't have to worry about
burning the surface to a cinder!

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.300
A goIden sword...

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.140
ExcaIibur!

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.680
That sword is--

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.560
Saber...

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.530
It's burning...! My Command
SeaIs are burning up!

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.530
Shinji!

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.340
Wait, Shinji!

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.040
Saber!

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.960
Saber!

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:56.560
Saber!

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.570
Hey! Snap out of it,
Saber!

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.970
Saber!

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:24.150
Fukai fukai mori no naka
honoka kaoru itoshii...

Fate Stay Night...

Next time,
