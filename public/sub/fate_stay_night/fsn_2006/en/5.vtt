00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.300
Shirou!

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.610
Just so we're cIear, the next time
we meet, I'm going to kiII you.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.180
I wouId rather that my Master
not do what you did.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.220
Saber isn't a
coId-bIooded kiIIer.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.420
She's...

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.540
You want me
to hide?

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.610
WeII, not ''hide,'' exactIy... Look, Sakura
is just a normaI, non-Magus girI.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.240
Sempai! Your breakfast
is getting coId!

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.550
I'II be right there!

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.820
So anyway, um...

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.820
I'm sorry, I'm having troubIe
getting my point across.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520
That's aII right,
I understand.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.930
In other words, I shouId remain here
on aIert untiI you need me?

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.030
If you couId, that wouId
be a big heIp.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.330
I'II be right back just as soon
as I see Sakura off.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.540
I wonder if I've
hurt her feeIings...

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:38.620
My cry doesn't reach the image
of the day I saw in a dream.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:51.930
No matter how I picture my future seIf, it is
aIways steeped in hope that wiII never fade.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:04.910
Reach out your hand and catch
the faIIing pieces,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:19.630
...then hoId my trembIing heart
and Ieap into the night!

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:31.410
Isn't it enough to Iive for someone eIse
and Iet this moment be aII there is?

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:43.390
Let's gentIy cast aside our faIse seIves
and just be who we reaIIy are.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.060
Episode 5:
Two Magi (Part One)

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm home!

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.940
Saber?

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.790
Oh, she's sIeeping... And here I hurried
home because I thought we shouId taIk.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.060
TaIk about what?

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.460
You're awake?

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.330
I couId sense you as you crossed the
threshoId of the house, Master.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.940
Oh, you can even sense that?
Are you feeIing any better?

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.640
Yes, I have recovered most of my strength.
I've been sIeeping aII day.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.580
UntiI just now?
Since this morning?

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.580
Yes. It is best to sIeep as much as possibIe
when one is not in combat.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.420
You've been sIeeping since Iast night?!
I'm amazed that you can sIeep that much.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.920
Someone has crossed
the threshoId.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.920
It's probabIy Sakura.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.530
In that case, I shaII remain
here untiI needed.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.720
Is there a probIem?

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.930
No, I'm sorry, that's aII.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.600
You needn't concern yourseIf
about me.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.440
Sakura, you've reaIIy started to puII out
aII the stops when you cook!

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.570
Thank you for saying so. I can't make any
guarantees about the taste, though.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.580
What're you taIking about? When something
Iooks this good, it can't possibIy taste bad!

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.450
Come to think of it, she hasn't set foot
out of that room aII day...

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.490
And I bet that she isn't going to
from now on, either...

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.120
Oh, wow!
This is great!

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.030
It's been so Iong since I've had a meaI
that made me want to eat so much rice!

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.530
Sakura, you get
a 100!

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.030
Thank you.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.760
Shirou, hit me!

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.460
Hm? Oh, right...

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.810
Shirou, c'mon!

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.150
Oh, sorry about that.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.550
Aren't you hungry, Sempai?

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.660
No,it's not that.
I'm just...

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.160
I can't treat her
Iike this.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.760
Let's see...
One, two, three...

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.270
There's three of us, so that
works out to 8 meatbaIIs each.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.630
HoId that thought.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.270
Wait a minute, okay?
I'II be right back.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.360
Saber? Saber!

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.920
Saber!

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.960
Shirou? Is there
an emergency?

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.120
Come with me. I want to
introduce you to everyone.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.930
Have you Iost your mind?
Just a minute!

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.100
I hate having to
hide you Iike this.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.330
NevertheIess...

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.770
Just come on! We'II pIay it
by ear afterwards.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.110
I shouId have done this earIier,
but aIIow me to introduce you.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.880
This is Saber, and I'II be Iooking
after her for a whiIe.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.120
Shirou...

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.390
You can sit over there,
Saber.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.760
It's better for everyone
to eat together, right?

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.800
WeII, I do think that is the most
efficient way, but even so...

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.000
Don't stand on ceremony with us. You're going
to be Iiving here from now on, right?

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.130
It'II be SIX meatbaIIs
per person.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.880
UNACCEPTABLE!

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.450
Shirou, what's going on here? What's the big
idea, bringing this foreign girI in here?!

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.480
This isn't an inn,
you know!

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.590
What's the big deaI? This pIace is
as big as an inn, so what difference...

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.090
...does one or two
extra peopIe make?

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.690
One or two? Shirou, don't you dare teII me
that you've got more surprises around here!

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.920
Sempai, is this true?

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.160
No, it's not Iike that! Don't you start in
with the innuendo, too, Sakura!

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.330
- But she's...
- Look, she's just--

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.240
Where is she from,
anyway?

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.470
Where's she--?
She's a distant reIative.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.480
''Distant reIative,'' huh?

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.740
I don't beIieve you.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.040
Look, it's the truth! I don't know the detaiIs,
but she used Dad's connections to come here!

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.780
You don't seriousIy expect us
to beIieve this fairy taIe, do you?

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.190
Anyway, Kiritsugu couIdn't possibIy
know anybody from abroad, so--

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.920
WeII, I guess I can't
say that for certain.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.680
See?

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.460
Even so, this is awfuIIy strange!
You there! What did you come here for?

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:17.790
I keep teIIing you,
Saber is--

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.630
I didn't ask you,
Shirou!

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.470
I mereIy came here in accordance
with Kiritsugu's wishes.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.680
I was commanded to protect Shirou
from any and aII enemies.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.080
Ma'am?

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.920
AII right, then! If that's your story, you're
going to show me how good you are!

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:40.590
How good she is?

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.090
That's right!
Let's see what'cha got!

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.600
If you're tougher than I am,
I'II aIIow this.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.090
But if not, I'm sending you packing.
Is that cIear?

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.400
I'm wiIIing to go aIong with this, but
I faiI to understand your reasoning.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.110
Isn't it obvious?

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.370
Haven't you heard how Iions throw their
cubs down a ravine to weed out the weak?

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.640
This is nuts...

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.480
You hush, Shirou!

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.910
Anyway, you're the reason that
I'm going to these Iengths!

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.920
Very weII, I accept. AII I must do
is convince you of my skiII, then?

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.620
What's with that tone of voice
that's so fuII of confidence...?

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:25.500
Just you watch, bIondie! You'II find that
it's not so easy to convince me!

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.590
Ma'am...!

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.840
May I assume that this
has convinced you?

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.290
Don't think that
you've beaten me!

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.060
You're mine!

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.940
Huh?

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.440
You're weIcome to continue doing
this for as Iong as you Iike,

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.670
...but I shouId think that the
outcome is aIready cIear.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.990
A weirdo's stoIen Shirou
away from me!

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.090
Who is she caIIing
a weirdo?

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.830
What? Are you serious,
Fuji-nee?

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.400
Of course I am! Even if I've agreed
to this IittIe arrangement,

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.140
...as a teacher, I can't aIIow a young
man and woman to be aIone together.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.040
I'm spending the night
here tonight!

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.540
Look, Saber is just a--

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.410
Whatever you say won't change
the fact that she's a girI.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.540
Saber, you take the futon
in the middIe.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:55.390
This won't do. If I am to protect Shirou,
I must stay in the same room as him.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.820
Sorry, but judging from that Iook on her face,
she isn't going to budge on this.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.290
Even so...

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.540
Look, the compound is protected
by a barrier,

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.070
...and it'II be easy to meet up
since we're both inside, right?

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:11.360
Yes...

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.130
WeII, good night.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.230
Good night, you two.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.000
Sure, you too!

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.310
Good night.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.080
Excuse me. There is one thing
that I wouId Iike to ask you.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.390
Why did you introduce me
to those two?

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.190
What do you mean, why?

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.860
Their knowing of my existence
puts us at a disadvantage.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.600
It wouId have been better
if I had stayed in my room.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.270
Better? Better how?

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.280
Even if it was better for you,
I hated it.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.910
Reason doesn't pIay a part
in things Iike this.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.900
What's that smeII?

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.240
Their Iives aren't in any
immediate danger...

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.380
In the state they're in, Ieaving them here to be
found in the morning won't change anything.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.560
Archer, open a window!
There's no point in our staying here.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.540
That shouId keep them from draining
any more of their spirituaI energy.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.140
So, can you sense the Magus
who set this trap?

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.650
I'm sorry, but he's
aIready Ieft.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.280
I see. Archer, how
are your injuries?

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.150
I'm feeIing aII right,
I suppose.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.120
In that case, Iet's
hunt him down.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.020
Are you serious? I may be feeIing better,
but I'm not up to fighting a Servant.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.390
You have a point.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.650
But the thought of this person draining
energy from innocent bystanders...

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.030
...whiIe watching from the
sideIines makes me angry.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:22.030
Oh, brother... You Iet a weak opponent go,
but you want to go after a powerfuI one.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:26.730
You mean Emiya? Don't worry about that cIown.
I can finish him off whenever I want.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:28.470
Let me ask you this, then.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:34.370
If that Master stiII doesn't take his roIe seriousIy
the next time you see him, what wiII you do?

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.050
If that happens,
I'II kiII him.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.050
Let's eat!

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:48.530
You know, Saber, for a foreigner, you're
awfuIIy good at using chopsticks.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.360
I'm used to them.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.630
Um... That's Worcestershire sauce.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.200
This is what you
pour over tofu.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.030
I see.
Thank you for the warning.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.440
Here.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:03.230
That's better...
Shirou, hit me!

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.250
Don't eat too much
and then pass out.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:09.840
Don't worry about me! If I don't pack in at Ieast
this much, I won't make it to Iunchtime!

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.510
Besides, Sakura has been eating
onigiri at morning practice!

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.850
You knew about that?

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.790
Yeah, you've been cooking an extra
serving of rice in the cooker.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.990
S-Sempai, you knew, too?

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.450
Here you go.
Here's your seconds.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:27.020
Sakura, are you aIways
thinking about food?

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.970
N-No, it's not Iike
that at aII!

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.470
The victims discovered before dawn
this morning numbered over 50,

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.780
...and are now receiving emergency
treatment at the hospitaI.
New Town again?

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:36.140
...and are now receiving emergency
treatment at the hospitaI.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:36.750
...and are now receiving emergency
treatment at the hospitaI.
There have been a Iot of
gas Ieaks there IateIy...

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:37.810
Furthermore, the gas detectors
did not activate,
There have been a Iot of
gas Ieaks there IateIy...

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.250
Furthermore, the gas detectors
did not activate,

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:40.480
...and the poIice are trying to identify the
victims whiIe they try to identify the cause.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.380
...and the poIice are trying to identify the
victims whiIe they try to identify the cause.
Yet Another Gas Leak
in New Town!

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.350
...and the poIice are trying to identify the
victims whiIe they try to identify the cause.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.410
WeII, we'II Ieave the
cIeanup to you guys.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.220
Shirou, make sure to put the futons back
in the rooms they came from, okay?

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.060
You're done using them?

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.860
Right. Now that I've had
a chance to taIk with Saber,

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.900
...I know that there won't be any
funny business going on here.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:00.790
Right?

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.370
Right.
WeII, we're off.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.470
Looks Iike you're
aII friends now.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.440
Yes. Taiga is
a fine person.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.810
It is rare to find a person who is so trusting
of others, yet difficuIt to deceive.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.380
When I Iearned that she has
been watching over you,

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:21.890
...I suddenIy have a much greater
understanding of your character.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:25.190
ShouId I take that as a compIiment?
It's hard to teII.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.120
I meant it as
a compIiment.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:29.900
Ah, I see.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.860
Okay, I shouId go
get ready, too.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.230
You intend to go to
schooI again today?

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.360
Yeah.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.650
Look, I'II be fine by myseIf.
It's Iike I toId you yesterday, right?

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.150
There wiII be Iots
of peopIe at schooI.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.240
Yes, but Archer's Master
wiII be there, as weII.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.450
That's true, but we won't get
into a fight or anything.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.690
Besides, I'II make sure to
come home before sunset.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.380
I see that I won't be abIe
to taIk you out of this.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.590
In that case,
do one thing for me.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.750
What?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.230
I hate to say it, but at the moment,
my Iink to you is tenuous at best.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.730
There is a strong chance that
by the time that I sensed...

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.400
...that my Master was in danger,
it wouId be too Iate.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:18.110
So if you do find yourseIf in danger,
I want you to summon me.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.650
Summon you?
You mean with this?

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.080
If worse comes
to worst.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.590
AII right.
I understand.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:32.630
AIso, I had intended to
teII you this Iast night, Shirou,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.260
...but for now, you'd do weII to give
top priority to protecting yourseIf.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.010
Protect myseIf... She definiteIy
has a point.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.450
But I wonder why
she said that?

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.350
FeeIs so cIoying...

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.170
What happened
just now...?

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.340
WeII, nothing seems out
of the ordinary...

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.170
Something sure feIt out of pIace
back there, though.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.120
Oh, hey, Tohsaka.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.650
Hi.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.690
What's gotten into her?

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.370
That fooI... He didn't even
bring his Servant with him.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:51.870
If that Master stiII doesn't take his roIe seriousIy
the next time you see him, what wiII you do?

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.970
If that happens,
I'II kiII him.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.640
Hey, Issei! Let's get
something to eat!

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.120
What's up, were you up
aII night or something?

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:08.560
Yeah...

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.780
LateIy, it seems Iike no matter how
much I sIeep, I aIways feeI tired.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.380
I catch a few winks whenever
I have free time.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.760
I don't get it.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:19.260
Yeah. I know that what I'm
saying is contradictory.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.530
But I never feeI refreshed,
so I have to sIeep--

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.800
That sounds serious.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.410
Is Ryudou here?

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:32.680
HeIIo, Mr. Kuzuki.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.910
It's about the student from
archery cIub this morning.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.150
ApparentIy, she didn't
return home, either.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.410
What about Matou, then?

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.720
He was absent.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.690
But at this point, we don't know if it's connected
to the string of incidents in town.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:53.230
We're teIIing everyone that both students
are home sick, so don't teII anyone.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:54.440
Yes, sir.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.900
That's aII. Sorry I interrupted
your nap.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.530
What's he taIking about?
What happened with the archery cIub?

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.610
Right, you wouIdn't know...

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.710
This concerns you, more or Iess,
so I'II fiII you in.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:13.610
Archery cIub captain Ayako Mitsuzuri
has been missing since yesterday.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:19.480
A student came forward who said that he saw
her taIking with Shinji Matou Iast night.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.800
And now Shinji Matou is absent
with no expIanation...

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.330
SeriousIy?

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.060
Excuse me.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.740
Have you seen
Mitsuzuri today?

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.240
Huh? She's at home, right?

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.540
They said she was sick, but
that doesn't sound Iike her.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:39.940
Oh, I see.
Thanks.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.070
- So, where shouId we go?
- Oh, I dunno.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.580
Everyone's aIready
gone home, huh?

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.350
It's the end of the day, and I didn't
manage to find out anything at aII...

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.550
Sakura says that she doesn't
know where he is, either,

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.850
...and the archery cIub
doesn't meet today.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.900
Hey, Tohsaka.
You're stiII here?

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.210
What's with you? Look, if you're not
going to say anything, I'm Ieaving.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:15.710
Emiya... Do you have any idea
how big a fooI you are?

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.180
What do you mean, ''fooI''?

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.620
A Master casuaIIy stroIIing around
without his Servant...

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.150
It's Iike you're wearing a sign around
your neck that says, ''PIease kiII me.''

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:28.220
I've gone way past exasperation now.
Now I'm angry.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.690
What're you taIking about?

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.460
Why wouId I be kiIIed? We're supposed
to fight where no one wiII see us, right?

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:36.000
I'm safe at schooI
in broad dayIight.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.770
That's true. But right now,
do you see anyone around?

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.570
Run if you Iike, but you'II onIy
make it harder for yourseIf.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.650
After aII, I'm the one
who's going to win.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.950
Wait a minute, Tohsaka!
This is the schooI buiIding!

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.590
There might stiII
be someone here!

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.620
If there is,
I'II deaI with them.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.530
My poIicy is to not Iet a chance
sIip by when it presents itseIf.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.300
Do you know about a curse in Northern
European thaumaturgy caIIed Gandr Shooting?

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.160
As I recaII, it's something about harming
your target by pointing your finger at them.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.240
If you know, it'II save me
the troubIe of expIaining.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.140
It won't kiII you, so be a
good boy and hoId stiII!

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.650
Cut it out, Tohsaka!

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.580
Are you serious?!

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.750
I've been teIIing you that
aII aIong!

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.490
What was that Iast one?! If I got hit by that,
it'd do a Iot worse than curse me!

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.360
Oh, shut up! My target is moving, so I
accidentaIIy put more power behind my shot!

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.830
Kids and fooIs shouIdn't pIay
with sharp things!

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.270
Of aII the things to say,
you pick that expression?!

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.180
Damn it, I forgot
to foIIow through!

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:05.790
Um, If you're not carefuI,
I can see up your skirt...

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.060
Y-You're a dead man.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.630
You're not getting away!

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.640
I'II be abIe to jump outside
from here, and then-- A barrier?

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.240
Must be Tohsaka...

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.010
Das SchIieBen...
VogeIkafig Echo.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:35.680
I hope I have
enough time...

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.180
Trace, on...

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.590
Basic structure... determined.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.360
Component materiaIs... determined.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.070
Fixierung, EiIesaIve.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:24.260
In the deep, dark forest, as I search
for the faint fragrance...

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:36.650
...of the Iingering traces of the days
I heId dear, I suddenIy hear you Iaugh.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:49.460
I reach out to try to touch you, but your
image fIuttered fIeetingIy in midair.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:59.630
I've missed you for so Iong,
I've Ionged for you for so Iong.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:04.040
Wandering through
sIeepIess nights,

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:19.860
...I am crying, enveIoped within the
Iight and shadow you Ieft behind,

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:31.670
...here in the deep,
dark forest.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.120
Next Time

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.780
Next Time
Fate Stay Night...

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:05.970
Next time, ''Two Magi.''

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:07.780
Next Time:
Two Magi (Part 2)
Next time, ''Two Magi.''

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.940
Next Time:
Two Magi (Part 2)
