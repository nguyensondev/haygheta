00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.500
This can't be happening.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.200
Takumi... why?

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.550
You're in the way.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.820
Get back to your car.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.450
Don't you dare touch him!

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.950
Do as you're told.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.220
Unless you want to end up like him.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.300
Do it, then!

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.890
Go ahead and kill all of us until
your hands are soaked with blood!

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.700
Kajika!

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.800
Let's go, Sahari.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.150
Let them clean this up.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.300
Okay.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.950
Let's go home, Takumi-kun.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.630
Chapter
Eleven

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.630
Burning
Life

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.950
Are you human or a Corpse?!

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.550
I'm neither!

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.550
I'm a Corpseless!

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.450
I will remember that day

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.450
Losing myself

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.750
In steam

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.600
Countless mistakes are made

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.000
When I can't see anything ahead

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.800
You said

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.300
"Ask your own burning blood"

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.550
Answer my beat

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.100
Corpseless of the Iron Fortress

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.050
Stand up

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.550
And slam everything onto the ground

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.800
My soul is devoted to my friend

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.500
Burn your life

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.550
Change the world

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.750
My father was a cowardly man.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.400
Secret feuds surrounding
the Headquarter's throne.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.750
Which is why that night...

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.900
...it wasn't the first time...

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.000
...the lights were turned off suddenly.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.000
No, it wasn't me.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.100
It was... fear that did this!

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.000
After that...

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.500
...my father would only fear me,
continuing to alienate me.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.350
I couldn't forgive my father.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.450
But you said...

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.100
...you would help me and my father
mend our relationship.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.650
Your kindness...

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.350
...is your weakness.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.200
I will destroy that coward's fortress.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.650
Your strong claws are...

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.200
...what will end everything.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.150
Soon.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.800
Goodbye...

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.150
...Nameless.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.240
Diamond Citadel

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.800
Listen, people of Diamond Citadel!

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.000
The Iwato's gate, a key defense for
our capital, has been destroyed.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.100
And not by the Corpses...

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.250
...but by other men!

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.850
The man behind it is the lord
commander of the Hunters:

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.750
Amatori Biba.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.040
What?!

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.900
Insurrection?

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.200
So the hero has finally revealed his true self.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.900
Could it be resentment against the Warlord?

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.900
But there is nothing to fear.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.100
Diamond Citadel is an impregnable fortress.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.400
We are the soaring birds.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.050
The divine bird cannot be broken!

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.350
The divine bird cannot be broken!

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.350
Warlord.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.250
Should we still not tell them...
about the black smoke?

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.000
You mean, the monster
that destroyed Iwato's gate?

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.000
Yes.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.750
I think we should inform everyone.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.200
Are you the only communications
operator who knows of this?

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.250
Yes.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.300
W-War...lord...

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.250
Excessive information creates needless fear.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.250
Help.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.500
Help!

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.600
Nameless!

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.850
I...

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.600
It's my fault...

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.800
...that Takumi's dead.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.150
I never should have let him fight with me.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.750
No.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.350
I never should have gotten
involved in the first place.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.750
Even Nameless, if she...

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.350
...had never met me...

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.650
Even my promise to turn her human again...

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.500
She doesn't... remember anymore.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:06.850
A Corpse!

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.400
I beg your pardon!

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.700
The Iron Fortress has arrived at Platform 4!

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.250
The Iron Fortress?

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.650
Don't you mean, the Master Fortress?

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.750
No, sir.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.800
They say they have captured the men
who destroyed Iwato's gate.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.500
I am Ayame, heir to the Yomokawa family.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.500
I have brought you my captive, Amatori Biba!

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.550
Do not forget...
that we have hostages.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.700
I promise to follow your script.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.500
Ayame-dono.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Uncle!

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:27.900
It has been a long time.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.200
How you have grown.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And your father?

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.200
The Corpses is...

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:36.930
I see...

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.650
That is truly unfortunate.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.000
That should be sufficient greetings.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.040
So you claim to have captured Biba?

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.850
Everyone on the Iron Fortress worked together...

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.150
...to capture him.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.450
Everyone is tired from the long journey
after losing their homes.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.300
I beg that Diamond Citadel take them in.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.390
Diamond Citadel's inspection requires
everyone to be jailed for three days,

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.650
regardless of the existence of bite marks.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:05.350
So I was told.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.400
You two will come to meet the Warlord.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:27.300
Ikoma?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.900
Kurusu?

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.400
What are you doing here?

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:33.950
Where's Ayame-sama?

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.750
Where's everyone else?

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.650
They have been captured... by Biba.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:39.850
What?!

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.150
Takumi's been killed.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.850
Nameless's been turned into
an enemy and attacked me.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.630
And so you ran away with your tail
tucked between your legs?!

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:52.100
I couldn't do anything!

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.000
There was nothing I could do!

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.950
Don't give me that!

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.100
Are you quite finished?

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.100
So you're alive, Wild Corpseless.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.250
I see a sword mark next to your heart.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.250
Did Nameless do this?

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.050
Get up, Ikoma.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.900
We're going after the Iron Fortress.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.000
No... I can't.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.900
I'm better off dead.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.450
Fine.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.850
You can go ahead and die, then.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.700
It seems that I was wrong about you.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.150
It's been a long time, Biba.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.800
Yes... father.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.800
You can drop the act.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.350
I know that you're up to something.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.320
Bring it here.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:02.950
Yes, sir.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.500
I found something very nostalgic
amongst your belongings.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.000
It is the only thing...

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.550
...I ever received from you.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.850
I thought I would return it to you.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.250
Father...

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.850
...if you pity me...

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.700
...please at least...

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:29.300
...kill me with your own hands.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:38.500
Very well.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.050
Father...

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.800
...before I die...

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.250
...there's something I would like to tell you.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.100
I would like to tell you...

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.950
...how I was able to survive fighting
the Corpses all this time.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.900
The biggest threat from the Corpses
is their ability to hide amongst people.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.850
Even at this moment,
they are increasing in numbers.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.500
And I am able to tell them apart.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.450
That's how I was able to survive.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.600
Do you mean, the bite marks?

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.000
That's why we perform the inspections!

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.600
You can't find the Corpses
with your inspections!

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.100
As proof of that, they are
amongst you here and now.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.200
Take a good look!

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.300
If you find one, kill it before it kills you!

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.750
Or else...

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.350
...you will become a Corpse next!

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.850
Bastard, how dare you aim your gun at me!

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.600
Look!

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.250
It is the sign of the Corpse!

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.120
Warlord!

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.000
Keep shooting!

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.400
One shot is not enough
to pierce a Corpse's heart!

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.300
Biba!

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.950
It was not me who killed you.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.950
It was fear.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.350
The Warlord has...

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:39.500
It is not over yet!

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.400
The Warlord himself was a Corpse.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.500
There are bound to be
many more hidden among you!

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.850
Give it to me!

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:50.700
Let go!

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.380
You bastard!

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.700
He's a Corpse too!

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:01.750
Stop!

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.010
Everyone lower your weapons!

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.700
Ayame-dono, over here!

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.100
Are you a Corpse too?!

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.250
Are you?!

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.350
Watch out, or you might
get bitten from behind!

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.900
The Warlord was a Corpse?!

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.640
Which means... we have been
infiltrated by the Corpses!

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.750
By the Corpses?!

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.300
Is Ayame-sama safe?!

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.500
Calm down!

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.500
There is no way there are any Corpses here!

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.100
We have carefully performed inspections.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.020
You have nothing to fear!

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.150
Well said.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.100
But the Corpses aren't your only enemy.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.350
Their nightmare is about to become reality.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.750
Fight...

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.000
...my Diamond Citadel brothers.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.950
The Corpses!

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.300
They're already here!

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:19.970
Biba!

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.100
This was all your doing, wasn't it?!

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.600
You turned the Warlord into a Corpse with this!

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:27.800
Congratulations.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.950
Here is your reward for figuring it out.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.850
You bastard!

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.000
This is all your fault!

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.380
Hurry up, kid!

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.490
We need to get to Diamond Citadel right away,

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.800
or I'll miss Nameless's Chimera transformation!

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:19.600
Nameless's what?

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.220
I told you to hurry!

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.260
He's already given up on life!

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.500
He's no different from the Corpse!

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.900
He's no use to us now!

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.400
I will be the one who decides that.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.600
Let me tell you one thing before we go.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.500
Why do you think you are alive now?

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.100
The stab wound Nameless gave you...

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.100
...is just barely to the right of your heart,
protected by the steel membrane.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.850
One slight deviation and it
would have been fatal.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:04.750
What are you saying?

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.850
Judging from the location, angle and force...

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.450
...it required precise aim.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.300
Are you saying Nameless saved me?

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.950
She's still somewhere in there?

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.450
But that's over now.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.510
That's because they should be turning
Nameless into black smoke right now.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.150
Wait!

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.650
I need you...

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:37.750
...to tell me more about that!

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:52.240
The butterflies?

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.250
That's right.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.850
When someone dies, they come
to take their souls away.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.200
The butterflies beckoned him too.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.400
Everyone...

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.900
...have been beckoned by the butterflies.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.000
I...

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.950
...couldn't save anyone.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.100
I'm sorry.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.700
I can't turn back now.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.650
I was...

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.900
...beckoned by them.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:35.950
Mother...

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:43.800
...soon...

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.500
...I'm coming to join you.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.150
What do you mean "it's over"?!

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.370
The Corpseless who becomes the Chimera's heart,

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.400
loses their soul and their life.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.400
Is there any way to save her?!

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.750
If you inject her heart with white plasma...

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.400
...you'll be able to fuse
the Corpse's steel membrane.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.050
It should be possible to pull Nameless
out from the Chimera then.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:27.950
Give me that thing.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:29.400
"That thing"?

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:33.850
Not that one.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.250
I already told you.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.800
The black blood is an accelerant.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.350
It will stimulate the virus and amplify it.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.200
Just like the other Corpseless.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.050
Do you mean, Fireless?

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.250
That's right.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.650
But you won't become a Chimera
because you're a man.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.900
You'll just become a Corpse
burning through his life force.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:58.900
I need that power.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.750
It will be brief, like the
last light of a dying candle.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:07.000
I don't care.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.300
I'm going to kill Biba and save Nameless.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.450
That's all I have to live for!

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.100
Ikoma, you...!

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.900
Remove your restraint, Corpseless.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.600
Or you won't be able to realize your true power.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:43.750
Ikoma...

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:45.850
This is the moment...

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.000
...I...

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:53.450
I...

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.350
...become the man I can be proud of!

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.100
That's right, Nameless.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.750
Destroy it all.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.200
Fear, sadness...

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:23.250
...love— everything.
