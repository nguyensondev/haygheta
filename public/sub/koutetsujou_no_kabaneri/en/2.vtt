00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.950
Are you human or a Corpse?!

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.650
I'm neither!

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.700
I'm a Corpseless!

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.390
I will remember that day

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.810
Losing myself

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.150
In steam

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.540
Countless mistakes are made

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.830
When I can't see anything ahead

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.590
You said

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.130
"Ask your own burning blood"

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.010
Answer my beat

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.980
Stand up

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.360
And slam everything onto the ground

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.700
My soul is devoted to my friend

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.450
Burn your life

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.460
Change the world

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.120
Chapter
Two

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.120
Never-Ending
Darkness

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.000
Help me.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.100
Help me.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.750
I did it.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.700
I did it!

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.570
I stopped it.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.550
I didn't turn into a Corpse!

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.200
Ikoma!

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.860
Are you here?!

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.710
What is this?

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.400
Takumi!

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.500
The piercing gun was a success!

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.090
Ikoma, what?!

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.600
It was a success!

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.150
When I increased the explosives, the metal
steam became pointed like a needle!

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.530
You were right!

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.440
So then that Corpse there...?

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.550
That's right.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.650
I killed him!

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.400
Then you weren't hurt?

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.350
No.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.780
The Corpse bit me.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.500
Huh?

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.850
I got bit.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.650
Huh?!

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.000
Oh, but it's fine.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.700
I stopped the virus right at the neck.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.050
It's exactly what we studied.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.500
We might be able to save people
who have been bitten now.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.100
Takumi, we did it!

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.950
What is going on outside?

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.600
Have you seen my daughter?

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.250
Stop making the kids cry!

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.800
I want to go home!

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.950
Who's that?

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.150
Where did she come from?

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.400
I calculate about 8.7 kilometers to Iron Fortress.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.700
I have about 30 minutes left.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.500
Can I make it?

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.350
Momoya!

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.600
Ayame-sama!

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400
Ayame-dono!

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.050
How long are we going to wait here?!

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.080
We have to head for the Iron Fortress
soon, or we won't make it!

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.300
But my father said to wait for his signal.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.260
There won't be a signal!

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.300
As long as the lord is absent, we must
obey Ayame-sama in his stead.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.100
Why am I wasting my time with you children?

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.300
I won't wait any longer.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.300
We're going off on our own.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.750
You're still arguing about this?

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.100
We'd be waiting here till dawn.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.200
Nameless-san?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.350
What are you wearing?

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.000
Mind your business, child!

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.800
What...?

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.650
I'd appreciate it if you kept your hands to yourself.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.650
Is there anyone here who can run a Railfort?

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.250
Right here.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.000
I'm just a trainee though.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.200
What's so hard about moving something along a rail?

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.750
I'll make a path, so just follow me.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.500
Make a path?

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.750
Nameless-san!

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.950
Pressure?

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.000
Check.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.700
Ammunition? Check.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.400
Wind direction?

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.000
A little headwind.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.800
Oh, well, as long as I keep it close range.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.700
Watch out!

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.200
Let's try for 100 seconds, then.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.300
Purification!

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.450
She's opened a path!

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.650
Run to the Iron Fortress!

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.750
We have to run! This place is done for!

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.000
We have to escape while we can!

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.750
Everyone, please wait!

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.100
They're mad, totally mad.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.300
I'm not done yet!

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.800
Hey, look.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.150
The Corpses...

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.400
And you're the last one!

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.650
I guess I was wrong.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.200
Can't forget grandpa!

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:14.950
One hundred and 10 seconds.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.400
I went 10 seconds over.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.500
Ayame-sama, we should go.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.000
Yeah...

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.000
If we can mass-produce these guns,
we'll be able to fight the Corpses!

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.100
Okay, I got it, Ikoma.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.350
First, we need to meet up with everyone else.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.650
Don't push, I was here first!

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.350
Let passengers on before the cargo!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.400
Can't we get on yet?

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.950
Shut up and let me on!

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.850
It's the Iron Fortress!

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.350
This is an inspection!

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:47.800
Take off your clothes!

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.200
It's okay, we're humans!

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.300
Then show us that you don't have any bite marks.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.550
Damn it.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.700
Hold on.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.910
They won't believe you.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.050
I'll explain it to them.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.200
It won't work!

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.650
It's the Corpses!

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.900
The Corpses are here!

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.000
Hurry up and go!

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.050
What are you doing, Ikoma?!

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.500
If they see me take out the Corpses,
they'll have to accept me!

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.000
Don't be a fool!

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.350
This girl...

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.400
Hey, you.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:48.950
Hey.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.000
You change your look?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.250
You look different too.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.150
I mean... you're really strong.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.950
I guess a little.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.250
What?

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.850
You're not normal, are you?

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.250
There aren't any Corpses!

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.500
It's the Iron Fortress!

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.650
We're saved!

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.650
Hurry up!

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.400
The passenger car is in the depot!

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.650
It won't leave until you're all on board!

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.850
Please, no need to rush!

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.000
Did you lead everyone here?

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:28.450
No.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.300
They just followed me on their own.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.300
You're getting on too, aren't you?

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.150
Yeah.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.400
You!

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.500
You're supposed to be in jail.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.050
Yeah, you almost got me killed.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.750
Maybe you're already dead.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.550
That's why you were able to get out of your cell.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.550
You're wrong.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.350
He's not a Corpse.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.050
What...?

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.650
I've been saying it this whole time.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.000
I'm not a Corpse!

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.800
He's not a Corpse.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.250
Why are we getting on at the very back?

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.850
I want to be near the boiler.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.500
Once it's ready, the next step is ignition.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.200
Yes, sir.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.400
Ayame-sama, if you would please.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.400
Yes...

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.350
Master key confirmed.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.000
Ignite the boiler!

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.000
Seems like you got it to go.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.650
Nameless-san... thank you for your help earlier.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.100
Ayame-san, you're not much for war, are you?

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:54.850
Eh?

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.600
That's why so many people die.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.200
That's...

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:00.700
Nameless, was it?

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.100
We are short-handed.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.200
We will have you guard the rear cars.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:06.500
Huh...?

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.150
That's not what I was planning.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:09.850
What?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.900
You're going to have to handle
things on your own for now.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.900
I am out of time.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.250
She's asleep?

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.750
She's got some nerve.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.190
Considering all of that fighting she had to do...

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:28.200
...I'm sure she is tired.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.250
Well done.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.750
Do you see my father anywhere?

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.200
Not yet.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.100
It's the Corpses!

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.250
The Corpses are coming!

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.100
Close the door!

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:15.050
Confirming rotation, boiler at critical!

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.350
Commencing next phase!

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.450
Can't you go faster?

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.400
We didn't follow the proper departure procedure.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.400
If we rush it, the furnace could break.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.450
Stay back!

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.250
Purification!

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:37.700
Are we going to be okay?

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.750
Hard to say.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.500
What?

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.050
What are the Warriors doing?!

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.450
Isn't this working?!

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.600
Hell if I know!

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.900
I'm just filling in too!

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.100
Are the Corpses really here?

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.750
Will we be safe here?

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.000
I'm going outside.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.750
You can't!

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:06.850
Watch out!

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:12.400
Ikoma?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.150
Are you okay?

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.800
Those damn Corpses...

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.700
Ikoma!

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:21.850
Hot!

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.800
Just watch me!

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.050
Hey!

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.150
Did you see that?!

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.000
With this piercing gun, we can...

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.000
Ikoma, look...

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:12.650
No way!

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.800
I stopped the virus!

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.200
Why?!

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.050
Takumi...

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.850
...it should be safe as long as the
virus doesn't get to your head, right?

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.500
You know?

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.700
We studied those Corpses remains...

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.300
Takumi?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.100
Stay back! Where's the Corpse?!

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.400
Has anyone been bitten?!

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.350
You again.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.850
I knew I should have killed you earlier.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.150
Stop! I'm not a Ka—

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.650
Stop talking like you're human, Corpse!

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:50.350
Wai—

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.400
Close the doors, hurry!

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.500
Ikoma!

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.900
Wait!

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.000
Ikoma!

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:21.700
I'm sorry...

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:23.700
Ikoma...

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.000
Kurusu-sama, incoming Corpses at the front!

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:29.750
How many?

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.850
Twelve, but... amongst them...

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:33.550
...there's...

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:34.500
What is it?

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.350
Kurusu, are there many of them?

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.500
No, you should stay below.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.950
No, I want to...

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:52.650
That's...

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.450
It can't be...

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:56.300
You're wrong.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.850
Kurusu... but that's...

00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:59.350
Fa—

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.080
You're wrong!

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.900
That was... only a Corpse.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:09.750
No...

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:17.500
Don't stop!

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.750
Run over any Corpse in the way!

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.000
Signal tower confirmed.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.650
Terminating speed.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.750
Linking switch bar.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.750
What is it?

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.450
The switch isn't working.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:45.450
What?

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.350
Something is in the way.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.300
The drawbridge won't lower at this rate!

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:56.850
Is it the Corpses?

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.450
After coming this far...

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.050
Damn it.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.400
They got the water tank!

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.050
We're leaking coolant!

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.450
The Iron Fortress won't be able
to move if we run out of water.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.850
Wait! What are you going to do, Kurusu?

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.400
There's a manual lever in front of the bridge.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.400
I'll use it to drop the bridge.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.600
You're going to go outside?!

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.000
You can't! It's swarming with Corpse.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.850
We are Knights!

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.050
If we don't put our lives on the line now,
then when are we supposed to?

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.650
Look at this!

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.100
There's someone with the Corpses!

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.800
Is he a Corpse?

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.650
He's got to be.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:52.400
Then why is he fighting the Corpses?

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.250
Look.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.850
Look at me!

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.900
Watch as the man you cast out
spills his blood and dies.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.000
Take a nice long look!

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.450
Let's give him a hand.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:11.700
We can't sit here and do nothing.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.250
It's too dangerous!

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:14.900
If we open the door, the Corpses could...

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.750
They're just killing each other.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:17.940
How could you...?

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.250
I will save you all.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.250
I want you to live the rest of your lives
knowing the man you abandoned saved you.

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:38.150
And I will laugh at you from the afterlife.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.050
And tell you that it serves you right!

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.300
He did it!

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.750
The drawbridge...

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:02.600
It's lowering!

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.800
We're saved!

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.350
I'm departing.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:48.200
Grab ahold, Ikoma!

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.150
Stop! What the hell are you thinking?!

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:51.900
Why would you save a Corpse?!

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.500
That's not a Corpse!

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.200
He's my friend!

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.000
Ikoma!

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.350
Ikoma!

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.300
Are you crying?

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.000
What an idiot.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.250
Hey, you're...

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.050
Pull!

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.600
Stop it!

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.600
Why did you do that?!

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.650
I'm a Corpse now!

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.650
Oh, shut up.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:56.500
We already brought you on board.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.250
I feel no shame being saved by you.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.450
If you still have any humanity left,
you will kill yourself for everyone's sake!

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.500
He's not a Corpse.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:15.950
Although, he's not human either.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.500
We are Corpseless.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.450
Something between human and Corpse.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:40.830
Even if the stars

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.380
That connect you make a sound

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:52.050
There are just dreams in the same rain

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:57.310
And lights are dried up

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:02.520
I am tired of getting answers

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:07.940
By mimicking others

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:13.360
Dawn without the sun

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:18.120
And broken morning

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:24.290
Smashed cry and dream
The ideal only has its doors

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:30.000
City is uplifted and drown in noise

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:35.390
I will still sing and stop turning the rudder

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:42.180
To hush silence
