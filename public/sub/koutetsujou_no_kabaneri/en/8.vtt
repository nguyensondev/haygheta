00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.100
Biba-sama!

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.430
Lord Liberator!

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.950
Long live Biba!

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.950
You know what, brother...

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.350
...there's another Corpseless
besides me on the Iron Fortress.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.360
He said he did the operation himself.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.830
Weird guy, right?

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.000
He did it himself?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.150
That's impressive.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.000
Biba Amatori-sama, I presume.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.750
I am Ayame, heir to the Yomokawa family.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.800
Yomokawa?

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.450
Then you are the elder's...

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.200
Elder Dogen Makino is my uncle.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.750
They're all going to
Diamond Citadel too, brother.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600
We owe Nameless-san a great deal.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.900
I had no idea she was your sister.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.620
Oh, she is not my sister.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.200
Huh?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.500
He just lets me call him brother.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.950
Ikoma!

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.800
Brother, this is the guy.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.250
He's my shield.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.200
So you are the Iron Fortress's Corpseless.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.390
I am—

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.300
I know who you are.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.100
You are the one who taught Nameless...
that the weak are expected to die.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.100
Hey, Ikoma!

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.800
Nameless, why don't you
visit the Sickbay?

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.900
Have your body inspected.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.550
Okay.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.950
It is a bit loud here.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.950
Would you like to talk inside?

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.700
Ikoma-kun, you as well.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Are you human or a Corpse?!

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.600
I'm neither!

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.600
I'm a Corpseless!

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.500
I will remember that day

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.500
Losing myself

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.800
In steam

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.650
Countless mistakes are made

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.050
When I can't see anything ahead

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.850
You said

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.350
"Ask your own burning blood"

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.600
Answer my beat

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.150
Corpseless of the Iron Fortress

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.100
Stand up

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.600
And slam everything onto the ground

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.850
My soul is devoted to my friend

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.550
Burn your life

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.600
Change the world

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.390
Chapter
Eight

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.390
The
Silent
Hunter

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.350
I am humbled.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.250
To have the Warlord's son
guide us himself...

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.500
I have already been disowned.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.030
I am no longer my father's son.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.200
Oh, but...

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:41.650
Stay back.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.180
What is it?

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.250
Biba-sama.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.700
Well, there is a leak, and we're
unable to build pressure.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.900
We have been fighting
constantly after all...

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.100
I'm sure it must have come loose.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.200
Do you have a wrench?

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.040
No, you mustn't, you will get dirty.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.750
Fighting Corpses is dirty work.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.600
Udo, you shovel the coal.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.250
Yes, sir.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.250
Fireless, please go on
ahead with Ayame-sama.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.250
Yes, sir.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.550
This way, please.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.450
Shall I help?

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.650
You might need filler.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.450
I have some on me.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.550
Yes, I'd appreciate it.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.100
Please wait here.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.450
Okay.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.550
What's this?

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.400
This is no place for a princess.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.050
I'll take your sword.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.700
We have been invited by your lord.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.450
I have no reason to
hand over my sword.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.340
I wasn't going to need it for long.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.150
What?

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.450
What is the meaning of this?!

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.550
Don't get me wrong.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.300
Let's all be friends here.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.150
Friends.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.200
Ikoma-kun...

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.950
...to answer your earlier question...

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.050
The strong survive and the weak die.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.900
Do you not believe that
this is how the world works?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.800
But...

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.250
...I can't agree if you're saying that
the weak don't have the right to live.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.150
I fully understand that.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.750
However...

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.000
...I'm not talking about
casting anyone away.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.800
I'm talking about saving them.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.200
Nameless saved herself
by choosing to fight.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.400
What do you mean?!

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.450
What is important for survival...

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.900
...isn't the ability to hide
and protect yourself.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.450
It is to stand up and
fight the Corpses.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.700
Am I wrong, Ikoma-kun?

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.200
Look at those numbers...

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.750
Can we really stop... all of them?!

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.050
They brought the Corpses here
on purpose to put our people in danger...

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.200
Do not worry.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.150
The Beaters will
take care of the Corpses.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.900
I'm sure the Liberator
himself will join the battle.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.950
And when he does...

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.550
The west gate!

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.600
Hurry!

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.900
What will you do, Ikoma-kun?

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.250
I will fight!

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.400
I see.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.690
Then I shall see you
out on the battlefield.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.400
Yes!

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.050
So they've come.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.950
How many?

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.500
Seven hordes.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.400
They have spread out
in front of the wall.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.900
There's no danger of
a hybrid colony here.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.800
Fifteen minutes is all we need.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.300
Just enough for one canister.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.400
We will deploy with light arms.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.660
After you slow them with
cannon fire, we will clean them up.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.000
Understood.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.300
Forge by fire, prove in combat!

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.400
We can't use the Guardian Cannon
because they're too close!

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.500
Be careful!

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.200
I will!

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.700
In the end...

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.000
...I guess this is all we can do.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.250
That's Biba's Railfort!

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.650
Incendiary bomb!

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:57.550
Fire!

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.050
All hands... charge!

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:46.950
Amazing...

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.850
They went to face them
outside the walls...!

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.310
That's right.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.550
If you wantto defeat the Corpses...

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.450
...you have to get close!

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.550
A stray Corpseless?

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.450
My guess would be that he
has a high pain threshold.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.050
Take care of everyone...

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.510
Brother, let me!

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.700
Okay, take care of it Nameless.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.490
Fireless, give her a hand.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.100
Yes, sir.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.200
Another Corpseless?!

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.500
Enoku, huh?

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.550
It's begun.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.400
You do not know...

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.450
...just how many people
are after your life.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.750
I am here after having met
some of them face-to-face.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.400
I am to kill you at the first opportunity!

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.100
I see.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.200
I can tell you where they are.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.750
All you must do... is ask it of me.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.900
Give me the order here...
and I shall do as you bid!

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:37.950
I have no need of you.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.500
Be gone.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.150
Is that...

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.700
...your...

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.850
...answer?!

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.150
H-Help me!

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.250
You lied to me.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.850
You already decided you would betray me.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.800
You are weak.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.850
Stop!

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.100
Why... did you kill him?!

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.920
He asked for help!

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.950
Ikoma!

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:21.500
Leave it to the commander.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.950
Is this man your blood?

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.390
Perhaps a long-lost brother?

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.250
No!

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.950
Then why are you so upset
over a man you barely know?

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.300
Because he was asking for help!

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.850
Stop it, you idiot!

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.150
Biba-sama was the one in danger!

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.250
I'm so sorry.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.700
I promise I will talk to him.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.400
I would also like to offer my apologies.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.370
It is just as we feared!

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.600
If Biba could be killed
by some assassin...!

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:51.600
Who goes there?!

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.350
Please come with me.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.100
I'm sure he only felt sympathy for him.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:08.800
Please forgive him.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.500
Very well.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.250
In any case, it seems
there is still much danger.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.150
If you would like, we could accompany
your Iron Fortress to Diamond Citadel.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.850
We can rest easy knowing
Biba-sama will protect us.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:39.910
Yes.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.100
We've all but made it
to Diamond Citadel.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.700
Is it really that easy?

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.200
Did I make the right decision?

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.500
It will reduce the Corpses threat.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.550
Is there something that bothering you?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.920
No.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.600
So, what's bothering you so much?

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.200
He taught Nameless that
the weak are expected to die!

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.700
He's not exactly wrong.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.750
And Nameless said that she's never
been bitten by a Corpse before!

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:07.700
Doesn't that mean...

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.850
...that she was made into a Corpseless?!

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.400
Let's talk outside.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.000
Fight.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.050
If you want to live...

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.450
...you'll have to save yourself!

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.450
That's right.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.400
Your mother...

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:43.700
...would have lived if she were not weak.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.100
Live on your own.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.950
Do not rely on others.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.600
You no longer need a name
for people to call you with.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.450
From this day forth
you will be Nameless.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.300
Indeed the bruise is quite large...

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.700
...but it should not be a problem.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:21.950
Are you afraid?

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.900
No, I'm fine.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.600
We're so close to getting
you back to your home.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.000
You're strong, Nameless.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.200
Perhaps I could ask you
to do one thing for me then.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:44.350
What did you say, brother?

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.550
Get the Iron Fortress's master key for me.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.330
But Ayame-san has the master key!

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.700
Is this Ayame-san...

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.400
...stronger than you, Nameless?

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.150
No.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.400
She's not, but...

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.350
Then... there shouldn't be an issue.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.750
L-Lord Biba!

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.390
What is this place?!

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.100
What are you going to do with us?!

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.100
I have not forgotten what I've done.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.500
That is why you tried to kill me.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.750
I only have one thing to ask you.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.450
Who left us on that
battlefield 10 years ago...

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.000
...to die at the hands of the Corpses?

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.200
You were... in charge of supplies
at that time, so you should know.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.200
Stop!

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.350
Do not lay a hand on Hirotsuka-sa—

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.700
Would you like...

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.150
...a new hole in your head as well?

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.850
I-It wasn't me!

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.050
It was the Warlord!

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.450
Don't kill me!

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.440
What is it?

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.520
It's the Corpses!

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.450
The Corpses are here!

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:12.050
Over there!

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.250
On the Master Fortress?!

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.300
There are a lot of them!

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.100
What are they doing...

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:19.700
...transporting Corpses?

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.800
Nameless-san?

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:27.500
Do you need something?

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:28.600
Yes.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.800
Give me...

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.500
...the Iron Fortress's master key.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.100
What?

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.300
The master key.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.200
The one you have.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.450
Why do you need the master key?

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.900
Are you not going to give it to me?

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.350
Are you going to use it?

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.800
Or did someone ask you
to get it for them?

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.450
Enough questions, just hand it over!

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.950
Nameless-san...!

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.550
You won't be able to
beat me... Ayame-san.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.150
So just...

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.200
...give me...!

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.550
I have the master key here.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:09.700
What?

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.000
I was using it for some
coupling work I was doing.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:14.600
May I hand it to her?

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.950
What? Yes...

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.750
Thank you.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.650
Yukina-san, what did you hand her?

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:24.550
The key to the boiler room.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.600
In any case, why would
she need the master key?

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.700
I can't imagine it was
Nameless-san's idea...

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:32.100
Ayame-sama!

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:33.750
Please come with me!

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:34.750
It's Ikoma!

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.900
Huh? A fake?

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.100
This key is to the boiler room.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.100
That can't be!

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:44.900
Because—!

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
They lied to you.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.200
Unfortunately...

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.900
...it seems that they do not trust us yet.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:54.500
Commander.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:57.750
The Corpseless man is at the freight car.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.050
Open this!

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.750
Is nobody here?!

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:05.250
Ikoma?

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.100
Nameless.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.800
If he forces his way in here...

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.600
...we will have to kill him.

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:16.700
I know.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.050
I'll turn him away.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:24.850
Why are you here?

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.200
Nameless... you have to come back
to the Iron Fortress with me.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:29.800
I have to ask you something!

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.450
There he is!

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.850
Let's trust him.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.400
Biba is hiding a horde of Corpses
on the Master Fortress!

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.600
You must have heard it too.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:43.450
You mean the Sickbay?

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:44.800
You knew about it?!

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.400
It's because we have
to know our enemy.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:49.500
Did they use that technology...

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.900
...to turn you into a Corpseless?!

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:55.150
That's right.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:59.350
I asked my brother to
turn me into a Corpseless.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.350
Why would you do that?!

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.200
It's because brother told me...

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.250
...not to be weak like my mother!

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:07.400
To become strong!

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.150
It was the only way for a child
like me to become strong...

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:13.950
Do you still want to talk about this?

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.200
It's not like you'd ever understand.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:17.650
No!

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.970
You shouldn't be in a place like this!

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:20.930
Stop!

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.450
I am staying with my brother!

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.150
Why does he use his power to kill people?!

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:29.150
It's... something a coward
who's scared of dying does!

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.000
You don't know anything about my brother!

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.500
So watch what you say!

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:36.200
Nameless!

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.150
Trying to protect yourself
is not being a coward.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.650
There won't be any more reason
to be sad if we all just become strong.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.350
What my brother says is right.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.500
Not that I expect liars
like you to understand!

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:51.700
Wait, Nameless!

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.850
Don't go!

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.150
Biba...

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.850
He's no hero.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:04.700
At that time...

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:07.900
...he was smiling.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:40.900
Even if the stars

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:46.000
That connect you make a sound

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:52.100
There are just dreams in the same rain

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:57.650
And lights are dried up

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:02.900
I am tired of getting answers

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:08.100
By mimicking others

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:13.700
Dawn without the sun

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.900
And broken morning

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:24.750
Smashed cry and dream
The ideal only has its doors

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:30.400
City is uplifted and drown in noise

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.900
I will still sing and stop turning the rudder

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:42.350
To hush silence
