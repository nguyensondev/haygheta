00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.350
The strong survive...

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.550
...and the weak die.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.650
He said that's the way the world worked.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.600
I can't accept that.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.700
He should be taken down.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.500
Just you wait, Biba

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.950
Are you human or a Corpse?!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.550
I'm neither!

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.550
I'm a Corpseless!

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.450
I will remember that day

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.450
Losing myself

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.750
In steam

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.600
Countless mistakes are made

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.000
When I can't see anything ahead

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.800
You said

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.300
"Ask your own burning blood"

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.550
Answer my beat

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.100
Corpseless of the Iron Fortress

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.050
Stand up

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.550
And slam everything onto the ground

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.800
My soul is devoted to my friend

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.500
Burn your life

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.550
Change the world

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.490
Chapter
Ten

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.490
The
Attacking
Weak

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.990
Everyone in red armbands head to the back.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.550
Traitor.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.850
Sorry, my policy is to follow
the guy with the biggest guns.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.700
Yukina-san.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.800
This is for Ikoma.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.470
He's with them now.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.750
It makes me sick

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.150
Do you think he really is?

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.800
Probably.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.700
Ikoma.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.500
Here.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.350
Hold up, Takumi.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.900
You're supposed to go over there.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.450
Please, I beg that you spare my wife.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.700
I will give enough blood
for the both of us instead.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.600
What did you say, sir?

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.000
That's fine with me.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.150
No.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.250
Where's the fun... in that deal?

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.300
Then I will give enough for three— No, four!

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.330
Very well.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.600
You have a deal.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.250
Thank you.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.700
Take the blood.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.250
Yes, sir.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.250
Warabi, I'm tired of you picking on the weak.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.450
How could you do that?!

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.450
Let go of me!

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.100
Judging from your weight...

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.800
...you could probably donate
thirty men's worth.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.900
Would you like to make a deal?

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.650
Here.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.350
When are you going to do it, Ikoma?

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.500
I can't wait anymore.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.500
Hey, you're in the way.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.280
Hey, Ikoma!

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.150
Tomorrow night.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.450
We'll do it when they come to take blood.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.750
Well, let's hear your answer, then.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.900
With your uncle being Elder Makino...

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.450
...it should be possible.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.100
I am to get them to open
the gates to Diamond Citadel...

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.950
...and arrange a meeting
in front of your father for you.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.150
If you will guarantee me
the safety of my people...

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.150
...I will have no other choice but to help.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.550
That is a wise decision.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.750
But what do you plan to do
after you meet with your father?

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.850
Ten years ago...

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.950
...the Headquarters dispatched 400,000 troops
to Kyushu to exterminate the Corpses.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.400
I know.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.850
You were the commander
despite being only 12 years old.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.100
When we landed in Kyushu...

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.450
...we were in a good position.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.500
We established several bases...

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.200
...and succeeded in cutting off the Corpses.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.200
However, suddenly...

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
...the replacement supplies stopped coming.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.750
We were...

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.000
...isolated among the Corpses...

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.450
...and were obliterated.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.950
My father was behind everything.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.950
I have to punish my father
with my own hands.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.250
You want to take over
Master Fortress's engine room?

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.150
The engine room is the heart of a Railfort.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.200
If we can control it...

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.050
...there's nothing Biba will be able to do.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.650
He will probably agree to release
Ayame-sama and Nameless as well.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.450
But the engine room is
located in the front car.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.750
How are we supposed to make it that far?

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.150
One of them...

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.150
...is carrying the keys.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.900
It's most likely to carry the blood to
the front car where the Corpses are.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.400
Once a day during the night,
he brings his keys.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.750
We're going to steal them.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.950
It seems we have no other choice.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.400
The people won't be able to keep this up

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.650
Biba plans to destroy Diamond Citadel.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.050
After we cross the Great Sea Harbor Bridge...

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.800
...we should arrive there by tomorrow.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.450
I'm worried about Ayame-sama as well.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.650
If something were to happen,

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.800
I wouldn't be able to face
Kurusu when he returns.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.150
You're right.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.300
We'll gather whatever
we can use as weapons.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:28.700
Let's go.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.500
Yes, sir.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.750
You think Nameless-chan will come back?

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.300
It doesn't matter.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.450
I'm bringing her back whether
she wants to come or not.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.830
That's what I've decided.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.850
Is Nameless-chan a lot like Hatsune-chan?

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.050
My sister?

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.840
Not even a little bit.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.000
Please don't compare her to that brute.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.800
They might be about the
same height, but that's all.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.950
I see.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.200
It's just...

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.600
...that it feels like someone
is telling me to do this.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:05.800
Someone?

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:06.850
Yeah.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:12.200
"Go save her this time. You'd better not run."

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.750
I wonder who...

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.600
Maybe God?

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:19.300
No.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.900
It's coming from you.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.400
I see. You might be right.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.550
I recently finally figured out how you think.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.650
Only now?

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.600
Then do you know how I think?

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.250
No, but you figured it out.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.800
Because you're simple.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:43.050
What the hell?

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.450
Sorry, I take it back

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.190
Are we really going to continue
our plan without Soue-sama?

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.550
We have no other choice.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.350
Don't play dumb!

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.350
You're the ones who turned Fireless
in to that hybrid colony, right?

00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:59.900
Why did you—?

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.500
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.450
Aren't you Tasuke?

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.000
What happened to you?!

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.650
Don't move!

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.100
Okay, just keep applying
pressure on it with gauze.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:26.500
Brother!

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.750
You're taking blood from the
people on the Iron Fortress?

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.700
Why are you doing that?

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.050
Brother!

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:38.500
I wonder, what do you think
the Corpses are... Nameless?

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.900
They suddenly appeared one day...

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.770
...and completely changed the world.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.050
The Corpses are our enemy.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:48.950
They need to be destroyed.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.750
But... thanks to them...

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.750
...the true enemy that must be
struck down has been revealed.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.600
I thought you were going to go meet
with your father in Diamond Citadel.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.700
I... don't understand... what you're—

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.300
I see.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.550
Do you fear me... Nameless?

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.000
Young Master...

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.100
...please check these when it's convenient.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.400
No problem.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.750
Nameless.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.050
I see that you like the people of Iron Fortress.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.450
It must have been a good journey for you.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.500
Okay.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.800
I will send notice that they shall not be
harmed as long as they remain peaceful.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.200
Thank you, brother!

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.150
Does she require repairs?

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.750
Very serious repairs.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.500
What else should we review?

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.600
If we get Takumi to do number three...

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.450
...and the support valve needs—

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:24.750
I can offer my support on that.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.000
Thank you.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.200
Well then, please do.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.900
All right!

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.550
Okay.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.600
Ikoma, here!

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.600
Line up.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.240
Today we're collecting from the blue armbands.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.750
If you want blood so badly...

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.800
...why don't you take your own?!

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.450
What did you say, you bastard?!

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.450
Corpseless?!

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.250
Takumi, go!

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.640
Everybody down!

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:16.900
Now!

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:24.450
What's going on?

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.400
Hey, stop it, idiot!

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.550
Let me explain!

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.300
There's nothing to explain!

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.250
Wait, Takumi!

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:38.300
Ikoma?!

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.400
It was all an act!

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.400
Sukari was feeding me information
on the Master Fortress!

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.750
We were using bamboo pipes
to pass on messages.

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.000
No way...

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.350
What the hell, so you were tricking us?!

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.400
Not exactly, but...

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.440
He's a traitor, isn't he?

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.500
You should just shoot.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.800
Oh, how kind of you.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.540
Kibito-san, I'll take care of him!

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.370
You bastard.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.400
I let you live because they said
a male Corpseless is rare!

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.050
Kurusu and Nameless are faster!

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:38.850
Die, you monster!

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.300
Don't you call him a monster!

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.180
What the hell is that face for?!

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.500
Is it really that funny
that I'd save the day?!

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.400
Well, yes.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.350
What?!

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.750
Bastards, how did you...?!

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.270
Understood.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.100
I will take care of it.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.250
Can you handle this, Nameless?

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.850
But...

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.400
...brother....

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.500
If you can't...

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.500
...I will have to give the order
to stop giving you medication.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.150
The curse will likely spread
even further throughout your body.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.150
I don't wish to see that.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.000
Be strong, Nameless.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.150
You don't want to end up
like your mother, do you?

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.850
I'm sorry...

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.800
...brother.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:13.900
I can't do it.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:18.750
I want...

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.800
...to be with everyone on the Iron Fortress!

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.550
I want to be able to eat rice every day
in a world without the Corpses!

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.750
So...

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.700
I'm sorry... brother.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.800
I see.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:39.800
What?

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.700
Let go of me!

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.200
Capture her!

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.150
Stop fight—

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.900
I made the right decision
lowering your blood dosage.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.100
Tranquilize her.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:15.550
Yes!

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.650
No!

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:17.600
Let me go!

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.710
Everyone's here, aren't they?

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:21.300
I want to leave!

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.390
Ikoma!

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.400
Now you will be able to
hear my voice more clearly.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.600
Go on ahead, Ikoma!

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.630
This will take too long!

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.500
Okay.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.970
Let's hurry up and finish this so we can eat!

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.410
With Nameless-chan and
Ayame-sama, of course!

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.050
Yeah, I agree!

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:02.550
What?

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:04.350
Why?

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.430
What are you doing, Ikoma?!

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.250
They're going to come if you don't hurry!

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.800
Damn it!

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.660
That didn't work.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.900
We'll go around the outside!

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:19.610
What is it?!

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:20.690
It won't open!

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:21.850
What?!

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:30.750
Biba!

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:34.850
Ikoma...

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.250
...I believe you were looking for this.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.550
We will cross the Great
Sea Harbor Bridge tomorrow.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:45.600
I predicted that if you were to start
a revolt, this would be the time.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.250
So I had the keys switched.

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.800
Well done noticing the keys...

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.100
...but you fell a little short.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.600
You fail, Ikoma.

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:12.950
Ikoma...

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.100
...are you okay?

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.260
Takumi?!

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.900
I did it this time...

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.850
That day you turned into
a Corpseless and got shot...

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.950
...I really regretted that
I didn't do this then...

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.590
But I finally... did—

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.550
Tell me how you feel.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.100
Tell me how it feels to lose your friend, Ikoma.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.050
Depending on your answer, I may
spare you and make you one of us.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.600
What is wrong with you?

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:11.550
What is wrong...!

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.850
Why did you do this?!

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.300
Are you finished, sir?

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.450
Yes.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.900
You'll pay... for killing Takumi!

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.500
You'll pay!

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:47.600
Bring her here.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.650
Welcome, Nameless.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.450
I want you to kill him.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.700
Nameless?

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:34.450
Hey...

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.150
What did they do to you?

00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.930
Well done.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:00.950
That is...

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.800
...my Nameless.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:40.900
Even if the stars

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:46.000
That connect you make a sound

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:52.100
There are just dreams in the same rain

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:57.650
And lights are dried up

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:02.900
I am tired of getting answers

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:08.100
By mimicking others

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:13.700
Dawn without the sun

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.900
And broken morning

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:24.750
Smashed cry and dream
The ideal only has its doors

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:30.400
City is uplifted and drown in noise

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.900
I will still sing and stop turning the rudder

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:42.350
To hush silence
