00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.510
Die!

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.240
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!
Die! Die! Die! Die!

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.120
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.100
Die!

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.090
Die! Die!

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.930
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!
Die! Die! Die! Die!

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.770
Dad was...

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.180
Dad was forced to endure this
for years?!

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.090
When I was young, I used to aspire
to becoming a champion of justice.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.360
Leave it to me. I'II make
your dreams a reaIity.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.030
Thanks.
That's a reIief.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.870
That's right! If Shirou Emiya is
reaIIy Kiritsugu Emiya's son--

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.070
The son of a champion
of justice, then...

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.380
If you're going to do this,
win even if it kiIIs you.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.650
...no matter what...

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.380
PIus, it is onIy right that Kotomine
shouId be defeated by you.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.890
...I'm not gonna be
beaten by that guy!

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.900
So put your Iife on the Iine.
Perhaps you might reach me.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.670

FinaI episode,
''The AII Too Distant Utopia''

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.450
FinaI Episode:
AII Too Distant Utopia

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.790
ImpossibIe!
You shook off my curse?

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.130
You are...

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.930
You just escaped from there, and yet
here you are acting rashIy again.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.840
Have you exhausted aII
of your pIans aIready?

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.340
Shut up! I never had
any pIans in the first pIace!

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.380
Enuma EIish!

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.560
ExcaIibur!

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.610
If this is my duty, then there's
one more thing that I can do...

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.150
Enuma EIish!

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.760
You were my...

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.530
Trace, on!

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.740
AII this time, Shirou, you were
my scabbard, weren't you?

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.340
The utopia that she
dreamed of...

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.120
- Its name is... AvaIon!
- Its name is... AvaIon!

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.460
Projection magic?!

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.350
Damn you! It'II take more
than parIor tricks Iike that!

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.990
- ExcaIibur!
- Enuma EIish!

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.440
Kirei Kotomine!

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.340
LaBt!

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.620
AvaIon...

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.200
The name of the utopia that the king is
said to have gone to after his death...

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.990
The uItimate defense
that nothing can penetrate,

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.560
...something that keeps even
the five true magics at bay...

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.070
That was your true
NobIe Phantasm?

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.640
The power of the sacred sword
that Iegends speak of?

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.350
You are a viIe woman...

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:20.360
You defy me to
the bitter end?

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.270
StiII, I wiII forgive you.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.160
Some things are aII the more beautifuI
because they are unattainabIe.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.870
FareweII, then,
knight king.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:37.380
You know, I had a good time...

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:48.390
How can this be? How can you
possibIy have this dagger?

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:53.120
It isn't mine.
Tohsaka gave it to me.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:09:02.400
I see... I once gave it to a certain
IittIe girI on a whim.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.410
That was, what,
ten years ago?

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.810
I see... It's no wonder that
I've grown weaker...

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.270
Trace, on!

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.030
I wiII destroy
the HoIy GraiI.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:21.950
Master, give the order.
Without your command, I cannot destroy it.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.880
Use your Iast
Command SeaI.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:38.500
Shirou... I want to hear you
say it in your own voice.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.050
I Iove Saber...
I Iove Saber...

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:53.750
I Iove Saber...

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.060
I want to make her happier
than anyone eIse.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.500
I want to make her happier
than anyone eIse.
I want to make her happier
than anyone eIse.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:04.960
I want to keep being
with her.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.830
I want to keep being
with her.
I want to keep being
with her.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.500
But...
But...

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:09.930
But...

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:14.370
If I reaIIy Iove her,
that wouId be wrong.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:19.680
If I reaIIy Iove her,
that wouId be wrong.
If I reaIIy Iove her,
that wouId be wrong.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.520
It's the Saber who wouId go on fighting
even when wounded...
It's the Saber who wouId go on fighting
even when wounded...

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.080
...that I feII in Iove with.
...that I feII in Iove with.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:41.390
Her pride is the one thing
that I mustn't injure.
Her pride is the one thing
that I mustn't injure.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.200
Saber...

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.740
FuIfiII your duty.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.750
It's aII over now,
isn't it?

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.060
Yeah. This is the end.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:22.330
I have been your bIade and sIain your
enemies, and I have protected you.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.260
I am gIad that I kept
that promise to you.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.700
You're right.
You did great.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.200
There is one Iast thing
that I must teII you.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.920
Shirou, I Iove you.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:22.560
Yeah, that's just
Iike you.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.910
Sempai! Sempai!

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:37.130
Good morning.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.880
Good morning,
Sakura.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.010
Breakfast is ready,
Sempai.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.240
Huh? Don't you have an archery
tournament this morning?

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.620
I couId've at Ieast cooked breakfast
this time!

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:53.090
I can't get going in the morning
if I don't foIIow the same routine.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:54.560
Oh. Sorry.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.190
Taiga! Stop this thing!

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.860
Brake! Brake!

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.930
Move it! Move it!
Move it!

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:16.280
Wow, you've gotten pretty
burIy there, Shirou!

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.210
You stopped my scooter
with your bare hands!

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.410
Gee, I'm fIattered.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.820
Just give the word, Shirou.
I'II kiII Taiga in her sIeep.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.450
What's that supposed to mean?! I was nice
enough Iet you stay at my pIace for free!

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.890
Watch it, or I'II throw you out
with the rest of the trash!

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.160
Raiga won't throw me out!
He says he Iikes me better than you!

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:32.970
Raiga won't throw me out!
He says he Iikes me better than you!
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:33.770
- You IittIe demon spawn!
- What did you say?!
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.730
- You IittIe demon spawn!
- What did you say?!

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.630
Wow, fried tofu first thing
in the morning!

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.140
Taiga, don't make
a scene.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.800
I mean it!
Out with the trash!

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.210
No!

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.780
It's because you said you Iiked
it so much Iast time.

00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:01.150
I'm in Iove!
I'm in Iove with myseIf!

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.330
What's with him?

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.090
He watched too many of the trendy
dramas that were on Iast night.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.340
So, I hear a new priest's come
to the Kotomine church.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.520
Right, and reconstruction work on Ryudou
TempIe is coming aIong niceIy, too.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.020
I guess things are getting
back to normaI.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.450
I thought you'd be
more depressed.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.060
What, and you'd Iet me cry
on your shouIder if I was?

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.870
As if! I wouId've kicked you in the butt
and snapped you out of it inside of a day!

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:49.740
What's so funny?

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.240
No, I'm not carrying
a torch for her.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.480
I guess you've aIready made
your peace with it, huh?

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.810
Yeah...

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.550
My memories might
fade one day,

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:08.790
...and I'II start to forget her voice
or her mannerisms.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:15.690
But I'II aIways remember that I
once Ioved a girI named Saber.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:21.640
Shirou!

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.700
Go on ahead
without me!

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:45.450
King Arthur... I shaII fetch
the troops at once.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.930
Stay here and rest
for now.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.630
Bedivere...

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.900
You have regained
consciousness, sire?

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.640
Yes, I was briefIy
dreaming...

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.770
Dreaming, sire?

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:03.780
Yes, it is something that I do so rareIy...
It was a precious experience.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.950
In that case, pIease rest
without worry, sire.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.860
If you cIose your eyes again, you wiII sureIy
continue dreaming where you Ieft off.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:19.830
To continue the dream...
Can I dream the same dream?

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:30.070
Yes, sire. I have experienced it myseIf.
One must wish hard enough.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:34.170
I see... You are a man
of varied knowIedge.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.150
Bedivere, take my sword.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:54.930
Listen cIoseIy. Go through this forest
and over that bIood-soaked hiII.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:01.470
Beyond, you wiII find a deep Iake.
Throw my sword into it.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.680
Go, Bedivere...

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:04.990
She feeIs so cIose, but I can't touch her
when I reach out my hand.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:10.670
But even if I can't touch her, there has
to be something Ieft in our hearts.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.740
We existed in the same time
and Iooked up at the same sky.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:22.590
If we remember that, I can beIieve that we're
with each other even if we're far apart.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.550
For now,
I'II keep on running.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.850
If I aim for what's
in the distance,

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.330
...I shouId eventuaIIy be abIe to reach out
and touch what I'm aiming for.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:46.410
Majesty, I have returned your sword
to the hand of the Lady of the Lake.

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:54.640
I see... Be proud, for you have carried out
the order of your king.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.890
Bedivere...

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.050
Sire?

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:14.130
My sIumber this time
wiII be a Iong one...

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:35.090
Are you dreaming,
King Arthur?

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.630
Are you seeing the continuation
of your dream?

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:53.700
Guuzen ja nai futari deaeta no wa.
It wasn't chance that brought us together.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:22:06.120
Zutto mae kara kimatteta unmei.
It was a fate that was arranged Iong ago.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.330
Me o tojiru tabi,
Each time I cIose my eyes,

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.800
...sora o miageru tabi ni,
...each time I Iook up at the sky,

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:26.430
...maboroshi no you na...
...those days that were Iike a dream...

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:32.450
...ano hibi ga yomigaeru.
...reappear before me.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:39.750
Michi wa susumu tabi ni tooku naru,
The path grows farther away as I continue,

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:47.060
...dakedo aruku yo kono mama.
...but I'II go on waIking as I have been.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.430
Watashi ni wa mieru...
I can see it,

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:58.170
...kimi to no ashita ga.
...my future with you.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:02.010
Kimi ni mo wakaru yo.
I'm sure you can sense it, too.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:05.240
Itsudatte sou.
You aIways couId.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.450
Kanarazu mamoru yo.
I wiII aIways keep you safe.

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:13.250
Yakusoku shita kara.
After aII, I gave you my word.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:19.920
Kanashii toki ni wa soba ni itai yo.
I want to be near you when you're sad.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:27.430
Guuzen ja nai futari deaeta no wa.
It wasn't chance that brought us together.

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:34.140
Zutto mae kara yumemite ita...
It was fate that I have dreamed of...

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:40.380
...unmei.
...since Iong ago.
