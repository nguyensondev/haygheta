00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.720
I desire the GraiI's power to
aIIow me to keep an obIigation...

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.050
...that I was unabIe to fuIfiII
when I was aIive.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.930
When you were aIive?

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.930
Nice to see you!
So, you're stiII aIive, mister!

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.170
UnbeIievabIe...

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.170
What?

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.180
At how sIoppy you are.
Is something wrong?

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.940
Not reaIIy.
So sue me for messing up.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.570
I expected this.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.580
Rin doesn't understand, either.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.260
Let's end our
morning training here.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.330
I must say, you're one
cooI customer, Saber.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.170
You sparred with Shirou for three hours, and
you haven't moved so much as an eyebrow.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.240
It's possibIe that my emotions shut down
the instant I pick up a sword.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.410
I've never given it
much thought.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.680
Maybe that's the mentaI state that women
have to enter into to be abIe to wieId a sword.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.450
We're weaker physicaIIy, so we strive
to gain an edge mentaIIy.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.560
No, that isn't it.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.460
I've never once thought
of myseIf as a woman,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.630
...nor have I ever once
been treated as a woman.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.440
I have come to
this era to fight,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.210
...so it is pointIess to concern myseIf
over matters as triviaI as my gender.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.240
Okay, then...

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.890
Now it's time for your
Iessons with ME.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.650
Don't I get a break?

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.120
You have a ton of things
that you need to do!

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.620
Hey, what're you--
Tohsaka!

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.620
AII right! I'm coming,
so Iet go!

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:10.850
My cry doesn't reach the image
of the day I saw in a dream.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:24.150
No matter how I picture my future seIf, it is
aIways steeped in hope that wiII never fade.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:37.140
Reach out your hand and catch
the faIIing pieces,

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:51.850
...then hoId my trembIing heart
and Ieap into the night!

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:03.640
Isn't it enough to Iive for someone eIse
and Iet this moment be aII there is?

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:15.620
Let's gentIy cast aside our faIse seIves
and just be who we reaIIy are.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.420
Episode 1 1 :
TempIe of BIood

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.930
AII right, we'II continue yesterday's Iesson.
Reinforce these Iamps.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.370
ALL of them?

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.370
I'm stepping out for a bit.
Be finished by the time I get back.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.480
See ya.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.350
Remember how it feIt
Iast night...

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.780
Trace, on!

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.920
Rin, what are
you doing?

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.720
Who IS he...?
I can't beIieve this!

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.950
Saber, did you know
he's been doing this?

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.020
No, I had no idea.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.530
I am a knight,
not a Magus.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.630
He's no Magus, either. Magic boiIs down
to equivaIent exchange.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.470
RegardIess of the Mystery invoIved, you're just
summoning materiaI from somewhere eIse.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.000
But that's not what
this is.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.710
He's summoning things that didn't
exist anywhere beforehand.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.540
He doesn't even know
what he's capabIe of.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.220
But I was wrong about him, too.
It's not Reinforcement that he has a knack for.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.480
AII this time, he's been the Iiving
embodiment of some kind of magic...

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.650
...that speciaIizes in doing
this sort of thing.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.250
Does Shirou know that?

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.460
He probabIy hasn't reaIized it yet...
He's such an idiot!

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.790
If I don't do it right at Ieast once,
Tohsaka's gonna chew me out again.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.640
HeIIo, Emiya residence.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.110
Hey, Emiya. You're not
at schooI again today.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.950
You're not feeIing weII?

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.290
What do you want?

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.220
Hey, why the
harsh treatment?

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.590
I thought I'd caII you
to teII you something.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.030
TeII me what?

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.760
I've had some vitaI information to pass aIong
to you, but you haven't been at schooI IateIy.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.330
Is Tohsaka with you?

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.530
Not right now.
She stepped out for a whiIe.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.880
That's good. I wanted to taIk to you as a friend
who knows what you're going through.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.680
Come to schooI right away.
Oh, and don't teII Tohsaka, of course.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.180
Shinji, what are
you up to?

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.670
That's strange.
It shouId be recess right now...

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.810
What the heII
was that...?

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.950
An enemy's heading
this way, huh?

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.720
Hey there, Emiya!

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:24.730
I'm gIad to see that you're Iooking haIe and
hearty. So, what do you think of my pIan?

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.530
You're the one who's
behind this, Shinji?!

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:34.230
Of course I am. As soon as I knew you were
on your way, I triggered the barrier right away.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.010
I put a Iot of work
into the timing.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.650
If I did it too earIy, you'd escape, and if I was
too Iate, we might run into each other first.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.990
I wanted to see the Iife draining
from your face, Emiya,

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.590
...so I wanted to avoid simpIy
setting it off at any oId time.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.220
So, you were Iying when you said
you had something to teII me?

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.020
Oh, I'm about
to get to that.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:00.970
I have to make it cIear to Tohsaka which of us
is the superior specimen, you see.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.500
You were aIso Iying when you said you
weren't interested in fighting?!

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.140
It's you and Tohsaka who are
to bIame for aII this!

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.450
I asked both of you to fight aIongside me,
but you both turned me down!

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.650
I didn't want to activate something Iike this
unIess I absoIuteIy had to, you know.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.950
Stop it! Do you have any idea
what you're doing?!

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.690
Oh, you're giving me
orders now?

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.400
If you want me to turn it off, at Ieast
get on your knees and beg me to!

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:36.900
I swear, you're just Iike Fujimura!
Neither one of you knows your pIace!

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.400
What did you do
to Fuji-nee?!

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.570
After I set off the barrier, she was stiII
abIe to get around fairIy weII.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:50.010
Everyone eIse was dropping Iike fIies,
but she managed to hobbIe over to me.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.820
She gave some garbage about caIIing
an ambuIance or something.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.790
Isn't that amazing?
TaIk about your modeI educator.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.190
But hey, I obviousIy couIdn't
go and do something Iike that.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.560
But she got aII cIingy, which reaIIy
started to get on my nerves.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.870
When I gave her a boot to the head,
boy, she went down and stayed down!

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.200
I wouIdn't be surprised if
she croaked right then!

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.710
This is your Iast warning.
Turn off the barrier, Shinji.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.950
If you hate it so much, Iet's see
you tear it down yourseIf!

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.090
AII right, then...
I can do that easiIy!

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.150
You reaIIy are a fooI,
aren't you?

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.390
The onIy fooI here
is you, Shinji!

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.310
Compared to the beatings Saber's
given me, this is nothing!

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:52.340
Don't!

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.550
Stay away!

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.750
T-That's more Iike it, Rider!
Don't go easy on him!

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.030
What are you waiting for, Rider?
Quit toying with him!

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.970
Hurry up and kiII him!

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.180
That's odd. My bIades
can't kiII him...

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:34.680
In that case...

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.120
Am I just gonna roII over and die?
Die without saving anybody?

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:50.160
Not Iike this... Not Iike this...
No way am I gonna die without saving anybody!

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.900
No, that's how it was ten years ago...
But not this time!

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.640
Come to me, Saber!

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:05.640
Shirou!

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.440
There's no time to expIain!
You know what's going on, Saber?

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.260
Just a minute, Shirou. Before I do anything,
we shouId see to your wounds first.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.330
DeaI with Rider.
You're the onIy one who can beat her.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:18.520
But that wouId
put you in--

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.300
We have to take down the barrier!
Fuji-nee and everyone eIse is in danger!

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.630
I'II use a Command SeaI
if I have to.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.810
No, I understand.
Give me your orders, Master.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.810
Defeat Rider!
I'II take care of Shinji.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.340
Right.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.000
So, you've decided
to join us...

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:11.050
I wiII beat Rider here.
You deaI with her Master!

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.380
She's aII yours!

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.080
You deaI with
these two!

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.150
It's aII your fauIt that this is happening!
You didn't kiII Emiya when I toId you to!

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:41.940
Shinji!

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.040
Stay away!
Stay away from me!

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.920
Trace, on!

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.910
Rider! What are you
waiting for?!

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.500
You do not disappoint,
Saber.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.810
Shinji!

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.580
Turn off the barrier,
Shinji!

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.420
Get reaI! Why shouId
I do what you say?

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.490
AII right, I'II just
kiII you, then.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.690
You're fuII of it. Do you reaIIy think
you're capabIe of doing that?

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.200
You and I, we're both
haIf-baked as Magi.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.440
But there's one Iesson
that I've Iearned perfectIy.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.610
You can try to gIoss it over
aII you want,

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:50.670
...but in the end, magic is a means
of kiIIing yourseIf and hurting others.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:55.780
So the first thing any Magus has to be
prepared to do is kiII other Magi.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.220
I guess nobody ever
taught you that.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:04.090
W-Wait! I'II do it!
You win, Emiya!

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.860
I'II turn off the barrier
right away!

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:12.230
Rider! Turn off the BIood Fort!
Right now!

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.780
You have what you wanted, right?
So Iet me go!

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:30.350
Shinji, give up your Command SeaIs.
Then we won't have to fight again.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.860
Are you kidding?!
You can't expect me to do that!

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.350
If I give up my Command SeaIs,
I won't be abIe to controI Rider!

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.500
If that happens,
I'm as good as--

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:45.570
Then go to the Kotomine Church.
He'II protect any Master who's out of the fight.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:54.610
Shirou!

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.210
R-Rider!

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.450
We wiII Ieave
this pIace.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.360
Shirou! Get back!

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.560
Rider is going to reIease the mana she
was using to maintain the barrier!

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.330
ReIease the mana?

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.760
Rider, what do you have
up your sIeeve?

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:19.130
You couIdn't even beat Emiya's Servant,
so don't get any funny ideas in your head!

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.800
I admit that I am no match for Saber.
But you can rest assured.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.870
My NobIe Phantasm surpasses
that of aII other Servants.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:33.050
No one can stop my bIinding speed,
no matter who they are.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.200
Shirou, get cIear! Rider intends
to use her NobIe Phantasm!

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.060
She was true to her word. She onIy used
her NobIe Phantasm as a means of escape.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.300
Shirou?

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:27.840
Shirou!

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.130
It hurt...
It hurt so much.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.370
It hurt just to
be aIive.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:59.100
I thought that if I couId onIy cease to exist,
it wouId put me out of my misery.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.670
I remember the Iook
on his face.

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:11.510
The Iook of joy on his face aImost made it seem
Iike he was the one who had just been saved.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.080
That's what
turned it around.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:19.820
That's when the weakness that embraced death
changed into the desire to Iive.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.220
Ever since, aII I've done is
foIIow in my dad's footsteps.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.060
I've never forgotten that expression, and have
been trying to become that vision myseIf.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:37.270
Yes... I beIieved that if I couId
smiIe Iike Kiritsugu did that day,

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:40.980
...it wouId save me
from anything.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.410
If you're awake, isn't there something
that you shouId be saying to me?

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.360
Tohsaka... You're here?

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.490
Don't give me that!

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.660
I've been Iooking after you aII this time,
and that's aII you have to say?

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.360
Oh, you were, huh?
Thank you.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.700
I guess I owe you
another one.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.280
WeII, it wasn't a big deaI,
so don't worry about it.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.810
Tohsaka! What about the schooI?!
What happened after I passed out?!

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.010
Kirei went there to
deaI with the aftermath.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.390
Everyone is okay.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.520
There were a Iot of students who had to be
taken to the hospitaI, but they're not in danger.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:31.230
Oh. So, did Kotomine
heaI my wounds, too?

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.260
No, you did that on your own.
Just Iike the time with Berserker.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.660
When it comes to your wounds cIosing themseIves,
your heaIing abiIity is aImost superhuman.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.400
You have no idea how
you do it, do you?

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:47.280
How couId I?
I don't understand any of this, either.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.270
Anyway, you shouId be gratefuI
that Saber is around.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:55.380
I don't understand how it works, but she's
probabIy the reason that your body is this way.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.310
Saber...

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:11.630
Saber.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.800
Shirou. Good, I see that
you are awake.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.110
There is a great deaI
that I want to say to you.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.980
Accepting an enemy's invitation
and going without me.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.850
Trying to fight
by yourseIf.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.760
And not giving any thought
to your own safety.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:37.130
Do you not understand? Each of these
is a fooIish act that speIIs certain death!

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.730
Why do you enjoy putting
my back to the waII Iike this?

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.170
Uh, I was onIy--

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.700
Today is the Iast straw. You are going to expIain
to me exactIy what you were thinking.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:51.580
I'm sorry.
I was an idiot.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:57.040
You have every right to be angry.
I'm sorry I made you worry.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.310
So Iong as you stiII here with me,
I'II never fight aIone again.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.820
Shirou, what do you--

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:08.160
PIease, I need your strength.
I can't beat the other Masters aIone.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:13.430
I can't do it without your heIp.
I know that aII too weII now.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.700
Good, so you reaIize that your actions
thus far have been a mistake?

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:27.240
You reaIize that your roIe is to focus on
rear support whiIe I do the actuaI fighting?

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:34.090
No, I don't think that what I did was wrong.
I stiII don't want to see you get hurt.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.590
If you're going to fight,
I'm going to fight by your side.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.550
You stiII insist on--

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.490
I'm not going to budge
on this.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.620
There's no way that I can bring myseIf
to send you in to fight aIone.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.380
That stubbornness is
certainIy your styIe.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.650
SureIy I don't need to
answer that by now.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:09.280
You know that I am your bIade.
Who eIse wouId heIp you, if not me?

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.160
What are you two
up to in here?

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:27.830
This Iooks awfuIIy fishy. You two aren't hoIding
a war counciI behind my back, are you?

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:34.410
Of course not. I was mereIy checking my
Master's puIse to ascertain his heaIth.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.620
Gosh, you sure have a strange way
of taking a person's puIse.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.550
Fine, have it your way.
Saber, here.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.820
What's that?

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.450
Saber's change
of cIothes.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:47.660
Be carefuI. When your armor appears
during a forced summoning,

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:49.860
...your cIothes are sent
fIying everywhere.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:52.660
Thank you. I don't mean
to be a bother to you, Rin.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:56.470
Are you okay with wearing cIothes
with such a duII design aII the time?

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.100
Why are you so attached
to those cIothes, Saber?

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.310
Because Shirou said that
they Iooked good on me.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:24.290
In the deep, dark forest, as I search
for the faint fragrance...

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:36.710
...of the Iingering traces of the days
I heId dear, I suddenIy hear you Iaugh.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:49.520
I reach out to try to touch you, but your
image fIuttered fIeetingIy in midair.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:59.690
I've missed you for so Iong,
I've Ionged for you for so Iong.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:04.100
Wandering through
sIeepIess nights,

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:19.920
...I am crying, enveIoped within the
Iight and shadow you Ieft behind,

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:31.690
...here in the deep,
dark forest.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:43.180
Next Time

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.870
Next Time
Fate Stay Night...

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.100
Next time,
''SpIitting the Sky.''

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.800
Next Time:
SpIitting the Sky
Next time,
''SpIitting the Sky.''

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.070
Next Time:
SpIitting the Sky
