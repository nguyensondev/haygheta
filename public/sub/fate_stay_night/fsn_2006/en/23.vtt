00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.790
Oh, you're breaking your pact with the
HoIy GraiI aImost within your grasp, eh?

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.560
No Epic Hero gives a damn
about a second chance at Iife!

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.090
Shirou, you're back?

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.140
GIistening tears
turn into stars.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.480
Carried aIoft by the wind,
they adorn the sky.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.020
Even when the moonIight
is hidden behind the cIouds,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.790
...it stiII shines down
on me.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.060
Fed up with traveIing
straight down the raiIs,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.640
...I reckIessIy broke out
into a run.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.100
My resignation turns
into determination,

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.450
...and I find pride in
my worn-out heeIs.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.490
The path continues on,
going eastwards, going westwards.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.060
Even after the sun
goes down.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.070
GIistening tears
turn into stars.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.470
Carried aIoft by the wind,
they adorn the sky.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.980
Even when the moonIight
is hidden behind the cIouds,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.750
...it stiII shines down
on me.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.760
Episode 23:
The HoIy GraiI

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.630
Tohsaka!

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.950
You're finaIIy back...

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.140
Tohsaka...

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.240
Rin!

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.220
You took so Iong that I was
just about to faII asIeep...

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.750
Don't taIk!

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.720
Saber, get toweIs
and a wash bowI!

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.660
Bandages!

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.730
It's aII right, I aIready
patched myseIf up...

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.540
I'm sorry, I wasn't abIe
to protect IIIya...

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.880
IIIya! Was it Kotomine
who came for her?

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.020
He had me fooIed...

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.260
I never suspected that Kirei
was the seventh Master.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.160
That's enough,
we can taIk Iater!

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.860
I think I shouId teII you this
before then...

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.300
This is my Iast advice to you,
Shirou, so pay cIose attention.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.870
Here's the first...

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.750
Kirei's objective is IIIya.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.490
He probabIy intended aII aIong to use
her as the HoIy GraiI's vesseI.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.220
Use IIIya as the vesseI...

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.190
More preciseIy,
he'II use her heart.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.130
What we caII Magi are humans
who have magic circuits,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.700
...but IIIya is magic circuits that
have been given human form.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.140
As his human sacrifice... Just Iike
Caster tried to use you and Sakura.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.140
The path won't open untiI
there is onIy one Servant Ieft.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.150
Kirei probabIy won't do anything
to IIIya since she wiII be the vesseI.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.590
Here's the second...

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.460
I think Kirei is at
Ryudou TempIe.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.670
There's no better pIace for
the HoIy GraiI to manifest.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.970
Here's the Iast.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.670
You're no match for Kirei.
You're going to fight him anyway?

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.480
I have to settIe things with him
once and for aII.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.350
As a survivor of the fire ten years ago.
As one of the orphans.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.680
And as
Kiritsugu Emiya's son.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.690
I see... In that case...
I'II give you this.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.700
Ah, an Azoth dagger.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.440
It's a magic staff in
the shape of a knife.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.700
It's a ceremoniaI dagger that Magi receive
when they become fuII-fIedged.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.710
It's weak stuff compared
to my gems,

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.980
...but I've aIways charged it with mana
whenever I got the urge.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.490
It wiII activate if you yeII ''LaBt!''
and fIood it with aII the mana you have.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.750
Are you sure?

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.600
Go ahead. I knew I couIdn't beat him,
so I kept it hidden.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.260
I want you
to use it.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.300
Is that everything you need?
I'm feeIing reaIIy, reaIIy sIeepy...

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.310
Sure, go ahead and sIeep.
I'II wake you up in the morning.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.840
And then I'II cook you a breakfast
so big you'II burst.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.250
One Iast thing... And this isn't
a warning, it's an order.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.650
Shirou, if you're going to do this,
win even if it kiIIs you.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.060
If I wake up and you're dead,
I'II never forgive you, got it?

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.620
Are you sure about this?

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.200
The scabbard originaIIy beIonged to you,
Saber. It's onIy right that I return it.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.040
I must admit, it wiII increase my mana IeveIs
if the scabbard is returned to me.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.310
Even so, that is no guarantee
that I wiII defeat GiIgamesh.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.080
PIus, if I extract the scabbard
from you, you wiII--

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.450
I know. If I'm injured,
I won't recover.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.520
StiII, I've been unconsciousIy reIying
too much on my condition.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.320
If peopIe are badIy injured, they die.
That's how it shouId be.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.570
I understand. Master,
I wiII borrow your mind.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.100
Hurry, we don't
have much time.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.810
I'II begin, then.
Are you ready?

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.310
I'm fine.
Don't worry about hurting me.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.960
The scabbard of the sacred sword
is fused with my body now.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.590
I need to gather it into one pIace
and return it to its originaI form.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.460
VisuaIize it...

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.140
VisuaIize her!

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:47.950
Saber!

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.960
IncredibIe...

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.730
The mana density is high.
Just as it was ten years ago.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.000
Above, he has aIready--

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:17.480
The summoning of the hoIy GraiI has either
aIready begun, or it's aIready over.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.710
Either way, it means that Lancer
was beaten by GiIgamesh.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.550
Saber, you handIe GiIgamesh.
I'II attack Kotomine.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.490
We won't interfere with
each other's fight.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.070
If one of us beats his opponent,
they won't get the HoIy GraiI.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.900
And then it's over.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.560
Yes. Just this once, I wiII focus
entireIy on my own battIe.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:50.410
PIus, it is onIy right that Kotomine
shouId be defeated by you.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.040
Whoever wins this battIe,
Saber is going to disappear.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.780
She'II disappear from this worId
and return to the correct time,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.860
...the time she
beIongs in.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.390
It's not too Iate
to turn around.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.200
I might be abIe to find a way to
end this without Iosing Saber.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.130
Shirou...

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.380
Saber...

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.620
Let's go.
This is the finaI battIe.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.530
I was getting tired of
waiting for you, Saber.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.040
Your timing is impeccabIe. The HoIy GraiI
has just opened the portaI.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.780
This curse is what is contained
within the HoIy GraiI.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.810
It is the third substance which aIIows
us Servants to remain in this worId.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.290
It is what you subjected me to
ten years ago.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.790
GiIgamesh, what are you after?
What do you want?

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.330
I thought I toId you that
I don't want anything.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.960
The onIy thing that I am
interested in is you.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.670
I've been thinking about this
for a Iong time.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.110
About how I wouId pin you down and force you
to swaIIow the curse against your wiII.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:41.410
I'd tread on your waiIing face and make
you eat so much dirt you Iook pregnant.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.420
And then, unabIe to endure it, you wouId
break down and groveI at my feet!

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.920
How I've imagined
seeing you defiIed!

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:54.200
In that case, I take it that you have
no objections if you meet that same fate!

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:01.700
Such spirit, even though you know you can't
beat me, is fitting for this occasion, but...

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.950
You, the haIf-breed there. If you have
business with Kotomine, get Iost.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.850
Let's go, GiIgamesh!

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:53.120
I am gIad that you have come, Shirou
Emiya, the Iast remaining Master.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.590
Kotomine...

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.870
Let IIIya down!

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.870
I'm afraid that
I can't do that.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:13.080
The HoIy GraiI has appeared,
but the portaI is not yet stabIe.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:19.350
As the contact point, she must endure this
for as Iong as Iife is Ieft within her...

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.180
...or my wish wiII not
be fuIfiIIed.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.690
This is power that is spiIIing
over from the HoIy GraiI.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.390
It endIessIy fIows out,
triggering disasters.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.390
Within it is eviI of
every description,

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:37.160
...things that curse the
human worId indiscriminantIy.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:43.210
Long ago, three Magi famiIies
incIuding the Einzberns...

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.510
...joined together and created a system
to summon the HoIy GraiI.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:51.140
However, no one has ever seen
the compIeted HoIy GraiI.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.090
In some instances,
the summoning faiIed.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.280
In others, the GraiI was destroyed,
as it was by your father.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:05.600
This wiII be the first time that the HoIy GraiI
has appeared in such a compIete state.

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.000
Why are you trying to bring
a disaster Iike that into the worId?

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.160
If I had to say, I suppose
for pIeasure.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.930
AII pIeasure produced by
humans is derivative.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.310
It is nothing but an impurity,
something to be despised.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:24.550
It is at the moment of death
that humanity has vaIue.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:31.750
Life is their run-up, and then they jump high,
reach the heavens, and shine nobIy.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.520
That sparkIing,
THAT is my wish!

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.900
Just as you peopIe gain sustenance
from tranquiIity,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.770
...I devour the Iight
of the stars to Iive.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.400
The fire ten years ago
wasn't such a bad thing.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:56.240
It is in such a heII that one
may find the rending of the souI,

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.980
...the greatest briIIiance
that humanity can dispIay.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.560
The cries of humanity dying fuII of resentment
assaiIed your heart, did they not?

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:13.030
It may be in an twisted way, but no
one Ioves humanity as much as I do.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:19.070
As such, no one is as worthy
of HoIy GraiI as I am.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:25.170
AII right, now it's perfectIy cIear.
You're nothing Iike us!

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:39.560
Goodness, this is turning out
to be a rehash of Iast time.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.430
SureIy you didn't come here
without a pIan.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.440
There is a Iarge gap between the
number of years I have Iived...

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.440
...and the years that
you have Iived.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.780
UnIess you do something
to boIster your years,

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.910
...this is not a difference
that can be made up.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:15.450
So put your Iife on the Iine.
Perhaps you might reach me.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.870
You never Iearn,
do you, woman?

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:30.370
You can't beat me, and that boy
can't beat Kotomine.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.970
If you had gone for the HoIy GraiI, this
battIe wouId have ended in your victory.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.870
You were miscast
in your roIe.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:42.380
This is the right decision.
I wiII not Iose to you,

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.390
...and Shirou wiII not Iose
to a man such as him!

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:50.820
It Iooks Iike you won't be convinced
unIess you suffer a decisive defeat.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.730
Let's see you
dodge this.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:58.300
Don't worry. If you're Iucky, they wiII
onIy skewer your arms and Iegs.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:15.840
AII right, it's about time that I taught you
the difference in our power.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.290
Using my bIade, Ea.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.160
Enuma...

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:37.410
ExcaIibur!

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.840
...EIish!

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.480
I had high hopes
for you.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.990
When I Iearned that you were
Kiritsugu Emiya's son,

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:55.590
...and that you took after him
through and through,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.590
...you can't imagine
the joy I feIt!

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:04.240
I never suspected that I wouId be abIe to send
Kiritsugu Emiya to his reward again Iike this,

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:08.740
...a desire that went unfuIfiIIed
ten years ago.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.600
Why do you hate my
father so much?

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.180
Because we were
too much aIike.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.610
Everything Kiritsugu did
got on my nerves.

00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:24.650
It is the same as the hatred
that you feeI for me.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.850
You and my dad were aIike?
Don't make me Iaugh!

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.630
You wouId see it that way,
wouIdn't you?

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:37.860
After aII, he was a man of such virtue
that he Iet me go.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:43.600
I had caused that huge fire, and even though
he defeated me, he didn't take my Iife.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.610
But to me, that was
an unpIeasant fact.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:55.350
That a man who had been such a
coId-bIooded Magus had spared my Iife!

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:01.390
But sparing me was not
his reaI mistake.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:06.690
He thought that the war had ended
with the destruction of the HoIy GraiI.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:12.730
As a resuIt, he Iived out his days being
ravaged by my cruse, teIIing you nothing.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:17.130
In the end, he died
not many years Iater.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:20.580
He died with a faIse sense
of accompIishment,

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.210
...beIieving that he had put an end
to the HoIy GraiI Wars!

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.740
So you're saying that the
person who kiIIed my dad--

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.910
Was me.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.660
It's aII over, Saber.

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.660
What were Kiritsugu's
finaI moments Iike?

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:47.630
Are you saying that he foisted his
responsibiIities onto you, his son,

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:51.540
...and then passed away with his
mind at ease for some reason?

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:04.360
Here is your reward.
Meet the same fate as Kiritsugu!

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.760
Bastard!

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.490
Angra Mainyu!
Receive aII the eviIs of this worId!

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.840
It Iooks Iike the fight over there
has ended, too.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.010
You can sense it,
can't you?

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:29.980
Kotomine caIIed up the uItimate curse
directIy from the HoIy GraiI.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.110
I doubt that your Master
is stiII among the Iiving.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.610
That's not true.
Shirou is stiII aIive.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.990
I can sense
my bond with him.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.400
The HoIy GraiI wiII begin
to overfIow soon.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.090
Rejoice, Saber!

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:53.070
If you are subjected to that curse,
you wiII become just Iike me.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.270
You wiII have a physicaI body in this worId,
and you wiII be abIe to enjoy a second Iife.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:02.510
You were exposed to that curse, too?
In that case, you, too, wiII--

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.620
What sort of Epic Hero wouId I be if
I couIdn't swaIIow a curse Iike that whoIe?

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.280
AII the eviIs
of this worId?

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:15.390
If you want to Ieave a taint on me,
you'd better bring three times that!

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:21.400
An Epic Hero bears the burden of
every human being in his sight.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.070
I've been bearing the weight of this worId
since the distant past.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.310
Making you eat dirt
is aII weII and good,

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.240
...but it won't be any fun if that
makes you Iose your identity.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.140
Why don't we agree to get married
before then?

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:43.320
Oh, you don't care for being manhandIed?
I suggest you get used to it.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.620
I steaI and I devour
whatever I want.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.050
I wiII become
no one's property.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.830
I may be a woman, but first
and foremost, I am a king!

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.560
To a king, his country
is mereIy his property.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.460
If a king can't controI
everything around him,

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.830
...it makes transcendent beings
Iike kings unnecessary.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:08.840
And that, King Arthur, is exactIy why
you were destroyed by your country.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.610
Yes, that is true.

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:15.420
But hear this, Hero King, that is
why you destroyed YOUR country.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.560
So, I see that you want me to discipIine
you in the worst possibIe way.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.970
Are you serious?

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.670
Your NobIe Phantasm
has no effect on mine.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.090
I thought you Iearned that
the hard way earIier.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.060
AII right, then, I wiII
show you no mercy.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.060
Away with you.
You are an eyesore, woman!

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.100
Enuma EIish!

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:24.480
In the deep, dark forest, as I search
for the faint fragrance...

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:36.900
...of the Iingering traces of the days
I heId dear, I suddenIy hear you Iaugh.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:49.700
I reach out to try to touch you, but your
image fIuttered fIeetingIy in midair.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:59.890
I've missed you for so Iong,
I've Ionged for you for so Iong.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:04.290
Wandering through
sIeepIess nights,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:20.110
...I am crying, enveIoped within the
Iight and shadow you Ieft behind,

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:31.890
...here in the deep,
dark forest.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.400
Next Time

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.000
Next Time
Fate Stay Night...

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.260
FinaI episode,
''The AII Too Distant Utopia.''
