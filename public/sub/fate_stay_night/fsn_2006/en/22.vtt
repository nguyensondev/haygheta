00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.800
Don't be a bad Ioser!

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.030
Once the stars come out, perhaps
I wiII divine Shirou's fortune.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.560
I am acting Iike one of those Iovestruck
damseIs one hears about in fairy taIes!

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.840
Saber, have you
seen Shirou?

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.170
Rin?

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.340
Do you know where Shirou is?
IIIya's fever is cIimbing.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.120
Kirameku namida wa

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.800
...boku o terasu.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.070
Massugu na reeru ga

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.610

Michi wa tsuzuku,

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.100
Hi wa shizundemo.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.040
Kirameku namida wa

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.480

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.770
Episode 22:
The ResuIt of a Wish

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.180
She's aImost reached
her Iimit.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.680
As Iong as the rite of the HoIy GraiI Wars
continues, she won't return to normaI.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.240
What do you mean
by ''Iimit''?

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.820
She stiII has a IittIe
free space Ieft.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.550
But once that fiIIs up,
she'II have to discard...

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.090
...her human functions, the ones
she needs the Ieast.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.630
IIIya was designed to break down
the Ionger the HoIy GraiI Wars went on.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.560
Don't worry, I worded that
to make it hard to understand.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.060
More importantIy, I have news
about Lancer's Master.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.570
You've determined
who it is?

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.340
Yes. I went
to his Iair.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.950
AII that I found there
were bIoodstains...

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.920
...and a Ieft arm that had its
Command SeaIs ripped from it.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.820
Lancer's Master was kiIIed
a Iong time ago.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.820
Is Lancer aIready gone, then?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.030
You beIieve that he was beaten by another
Servant after he attacked Shirou?

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.370
The bIood I found in that room
was oIder than that.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.080
My guess is that Lancer's Master
was kiIIed Iong before then.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.000
Do you understand
what that means?

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.940
Someone stoIe Lancer's Master's
Command SeaIs...

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.950
...and formed a new pact
with him.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.840
But Rin, that means--

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.080
Right. Shirou and I are the
onIy remaining Masters,

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.850
...but Lancer hasn't
disappeared.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.490
Which means that a Magus out there who
didn't start out as a Master is one now.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.930
Command SeaIs can onIy be transpIanted
by a Master or a Servant.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.700
No matter how skiIIed the Magus, he cannot
become a Master by steaIing Command SeaIs.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.670
So, expIain one other thing
to me.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.970
Even if the HoIy GraiI disappears,
if you stiII have...

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.740
...your Command SeaIs and a Servant,
can you remain a Master indefiniteIy?

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.640
Yes, I suppose so. If he stiII had
his Command SeaIs and his Servant,

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.950
...a Magus wouId remain a Master even
after the HoIy GraiI War ended.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.720
In which case, the one who kiIIed Lancer's
Master and made a new pact with him was--

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.030
Yes, that's the onIy thing
that makes sense.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.930
It aIso expIains Lancer's behavior
if you work from that assumption.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.030
He casuaIIy attacked
other Servants...

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.340
...without even trying to
conceaI his true identity.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.600
You have a point.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.480
It is standard procedure for Servants to kiII an
opponent who has seen your NobIe Phantasm.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.340
His roIe was to scout out
the enemy.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.880
Lancer's Master had another
combat-type Servant on hand.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.850
StiII, what kind of Master wouId use
a Servant of Lancer's caIiber...

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.620
...to do his preIiminary
investigations?

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.090
Rin, where is Shirou
right now?

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.260
I don't know, that's
why I asked YOU.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.090
You don't suppose he went
to see Kirei, do you?

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.300
At that church?

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.470
The air there is stagnant. That church
is not hoIy ground.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.340
That staIeness is the same as in that cave.
It is the stagnant smeII of death.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.580
Shirou is there right now?
AII by himseIf?

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.570
Shirou!

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.830
Hey there!

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.320
You know, this is the second time that
I've skewered that boy through the chest.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.220
I added a IittIe extra to make sure
that he won't come back this time!

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.730
Fiend! You used Gáe BoIg
on Shirou!

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.960
I missed his heart.
But he's feeIing the curse aII the same!

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.500
No wound infIicted by this spear
can ever be heaIed!

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.810
I'm so gIad that you're the
Iast one Ieft, Saber!

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.930
It hurts...
I can't do it.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:41.000
I can't do it.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.460
Send us back...

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.630
I can't. I can't save you peopIe.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.870
Give it back...
I can't. I can't save you peopIe.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.560
PIease...
I can't. I can't save you peopIe.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.570
W-Who's there?!

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.080
That's quite enough!

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.120
I suggest that you
sheathe your sword.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:22.500
If you have onIy come to retrieve
this man, I wiII turn him over to you.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:28.030
My roIe is to determine the
owner of the HoIy GraiI.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.610
If you wish, I can grant you
the HoIy GraiI right now.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.040
I thought it wasn't supposed to appear
untiI onIy one Master was Ieft.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.620
Yes, but the vesseI
is another matter.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.050
The vesseI is prepared
as a tangibIe object.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.630
Power fIows into it untiI the time
the HoIy GraiI is summoned.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:56.300
In this situation, in which onIy two Servants
are Ieft, I expect that it is nearIy compIete.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.330
The HoIy GraiI is waiting to be fiIIed
with the bIood of a human sacrifice.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.070
I wiII gIadIy turn over the HoIy GraiI if
a worthy person shouId present himseIf.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.850
To that end,
Shirou Emiya,

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.180
...for starters, I wouId Iike to hear
what you have to say.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:22.950
On that day ten years ago,
you honestIy feIt no hatred?

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.390
Ten years ago...?

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:37.770
Stop it! It's too Iate for you!
Stop it!

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:45.680
There in the fIames, under the rubbIe,
everyone wanted to be saved.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:51.550
But I ignored them aII and kept waIking.
I was onIy interested in saving myseIf.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.560
- Wait!
- HeIp us!

00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:00.070
It wasn't Iike I couId do anything
to heIp them. So I didn't stop.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.890
I ran on, ignoring the cries
of the dying.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.570
Considering what I had done,
I thought that I absoIuteIy had to Iive.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:17.670
OnIy one of us had our wish granted.
Everyone eIse died...

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.720
That's why I was so obsessed with
foIIowing in Kiritsugu's footsteps.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:27.160
I Iooked up to champions of justice,
peopIe who saved Iives.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.830
In my empty heart, I thought that if I didn't
move on in spite of what had happened...

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.060
If I didn't hoId my head high
and move foreward,

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.240
...I'd never be forgiven
by the peopIe who died.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:49.080
If it were possibIe to undo the events of
that day, if you couId do it aII over again,

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.150
...you wouId desire the HoIy GraiI,
wouIdn't you?

00:09:54.020 --> 00:10:00.720
Come, answer me. If that is what you want,
I wiII give you the HoIy GraiI.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.730
I don't want it...

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.200
Even if I reaIIy couId
change the past,

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.010
...it wouId be wrong to take
aII the tears, the memories,

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.970
...the crueIty of reaIity that
stabbed at our hearts,

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.950
...aII the deaths and sadness that peopIe
have endured and overcome over the years,

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.480
...and make it aII
for nothing.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.550
Embracing the pain
and moving on.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.020
Isn't that the onIy way to
Ieave behind those you Iost?

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.230
Just Iike I've been tied down by their deaths and
feeI protected by my memories of Kiritsugu,

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:45.530
...I beIieve that emotions are the key to aIIowing
the peopIe who are aIive now to change.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.270
No matter how much it hurts, even if
you carry wounds that wiII never heaI,

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.240
...I beIieve that this path
is the right one.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.550
I see.
In other words...

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.920
I don't need
the HoIy GraiI.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.660
I have to stay true to who I am, both for
myseIf and for the peopIe I abandoned...

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.200
And what of you,
Saber?

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.700
SureIy you won't be as egotisticaI
as Shirou Emiya.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.810
I...

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:46.570
Saber, kiII your Master.
Do that, and your wish wiII come true.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.530
My wish...

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.540
There must be someone eIse who
is worthier than I am to be king.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:58.340
SureIy this person wouId be abIe to
found a Iong-Iasting, peacefuI kingdom.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.750
I want to change the outcome
of the seIection of the king.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.350
If I use the power of the
GraiI to undo that,

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.420
...sureIy the kingdom's downfaII
wouId aIso--

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.280
I beIieve that this path
is the right one.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.830
Yes, that is right...

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.960
I drew the sword from the stone,
pIedging to fuIfiII my duties as king.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.240
I sacrificed a great many things
and fought for my peopIe.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.000
I have no regrets
on that score.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.310
If I can be proud of what I accompIished
in Iife, I shouId not have sought to change it.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.280
Even if it ended
in destruction.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:45.420
The king protected his kingdom.
But the kingdom did not protect her king.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.320
That is aII
it amounts to.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.660
Even though it ended in tragedy, if the actions
that Ied to that end were beyond reproach,

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.170
...there was no need
to seek to change it.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.170
I have sacrificed much with the
aim of obtaining this change,

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.570
...yet there is something that
I have protected to the end.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.140
Yes, I wouId keep that something
hidden in my heart,

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:12.950
...and I wouId at Ieast see this
unfuIfiIIed dream through to its end.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.550
I do desire the HoIy GraiI.
However, I wiII not kiII Shirou.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.790
Do you not see, scoundreI? I want
Shirou more than I want the GraiI.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.100
If the GraiI is somethng that wiII
taint me, I do not want it.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.030
I have aIready acquired aII
that I have ever wanted.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.940
Shirou, take my hand.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.760
I've got my strength back...
Saber, what just happened?

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.660
Nothing can affect you as you are now,
not even Gáe BoIg's curse.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.530
You two are
so tiresome...

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.270
You two wiII die here.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.970
AIIow me to introduce you.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:17.110
This is the Epic Hero who was my partner
in the Iast HoIy GraiI War.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.880
It's you!

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:28.020
What, we're going to finish things in a pIace
Iike this, and with a nuisance underfoot, too?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.760
What's going on here?
This guy is your Servant?

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.460
After the Iast HoIy
GraiI War ended,

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.470
...we entered into a partnership
whereby I wouId provide him...

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.670
...with the sustenance he required
to remain here.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.770
''Sustenance''? That's what that
disgusting room is for?

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.540
Why didn't you say
anything to me?

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.350
If I had, wouId you have
fought aIongside him?

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.880
I'd sooner die.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:00.390
So you were Iying when you said
you didn't know who he was!

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.830
He showed himseIf to you, disobeying
my instructions to wait and observe.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.630
If you foIIowed him, the traiI wouId
eventuaIIy Iead back to me.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.830
And so, I had to formuIate
a new pIan of action.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:20.310
Think about it. I never once
toId you an outright Iie.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.980
This is a repeat of ten years ago,
isn't it, Saber?

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.860
Of course, I had been
defeated by Kiritsugu,

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:38.260
...so I was unabIe to witness
the finaI scene.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:44.540
Finding myseIf in a corner, I touched
the HoIy GraiI when it appeared.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.660
And to think...

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.580
...that it wouId have
such a resuIt.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.710
So the fire was
caused...

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.450
By you trying to use
the GraiI's power?

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:03.290
I mereIy thought to myseIf that everyone
in that area shouId just go away.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.790
Even without my contact, the GraiI
wouId have done the same thing.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.730
Nonsense! The GraiI is nothing but a
tooI to grant the wish of its owner!

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.500
How, then, does it go about
granting those wishes?

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.600
The HoIy GraiI is effectiveIy
a powerfuI weapon.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:25.770
It is unaduIterated power, one which
onIy grants its owner's wish...

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.780
...by means of
destruction.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.650
Then the HoIy GraiI that I have been
seeking aII this time is actuaIIy--

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.650
A cursed chaIice that destroys
everything but its owner.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:43.530
GiIgamesh! Lancer!
Dispose of this trash.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.240
- Don't Ieave my side.
- Got it.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.950
Your target is supposed to be
that haIf-breed.

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.680
I changed my mind.
I want no part of this.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:14.160
Lancer, what are
you doing?

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.320
Don't get the wrong idea, I'm not switching
over to your side or anything.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.960
AII I'm doing is siding
with my principIes!

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:28.970
Oh, you're breaking your pact with the
HoIy GraiI aImost within your grasp, eh?

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:34.980
No Epic Hero gives a damn
about a second chance at Iife!

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.520
Lancer, not even you are a
match for him one-on-one!

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:45.290
Just get out of here! Don't think we're
friends just 'cause I protected you!

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.160
This is why I can't stand
you weII-bred Knight Kings!

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.090
Good Iuck to you.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:58.870
To teII you the truth, I didn't Iike the
idea of things ending this way, either.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.730
If you hadn't done something,
I wouId have.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.170
You saying that you wanted
to Iet Saber escape?

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.110
Because that woman
is my property.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:14.980
But to compIete the rite to summon the
HoIy GraiI, one more Servant has to die.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.520
You had this pIanned
aII aIong, didn't you?

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.790
Shirou, Iet me see
your injury.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.630
Right...

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:36.470
I'm sorry, this wiII
hurt a IittIe.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.550
The pain, it's gone...

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.390
I repIenished the scabbard with mana.
Your wound wiII heaI in a moment.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.160
Scabbard? Wait, you mean
ExcaIibur's scabbard?

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.940
Yes, the scabbard
I once Iost.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.830
Shirou, that scabbard
is now inside of you.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.070
For an untrained Magus
Iike you to summon me,

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:49.640
...a point of contact was needed
to compensate for that Iack of skiII.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:53.320
And that point of contact
was ExcaIibur's scabbard.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.820
But what the heck is something
Iike that doing inside me?

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.520
It must be
Kiritsugu's doing.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.660
My dad?

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.250
In the previous war, Kiritsugu
used the scabbard...

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.130
...as the cataIyst
to summon me.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.330
The sacred sword's scabbard is a NobIe
Phantasm that heaIs its owner.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.900
Kiritsugu must have concIuded that
it wouId be more advantageous...

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.840
...for him to keep it
rather than return it to me.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.840
Oh, so dad managed to win because
he had the same abiIity I do?

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.250
And then, when the
battIe was over,

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.840
...Kiritsugu came across a dying chiId
among the charred ruins.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.360
There was onIy one way
that he couId save that chiId.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.660
The heaIing scabbard
of the sacred sword.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:41.370
By impIanting it in the chiId, Kiritsugu
saved the boy's fading Iife.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.430
That is the source of your
regenerative abiIities.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:50.370
I'm sorry, I shouIdn't be using
your scabbard this way.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:55.020
Don't be. Besides, it made me
happy to Iearn of it, Shirou.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:02.710
I had never managed to save anything,
but I did save YOUR Iife, Shirou.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.320
Kiritsugu was right.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:14.230
I have no need of the HoIy GraiI.
He must have reaIized it.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.700
ReaIized that I can't go
back and change things.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.740
But in spite of that, I have been
deceiving myseIf aII this time.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.570
Saber...

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.350
Thank you.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.550
Thanks to you, I now know
the path I shouId take.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:39.250
The HoIy GraiI and I are both dreams
that never shouId have existed.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.760
Even so... I hope that you
wiII forgive me.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:49.330
This was a misguided wish, and these
were days that aren't meant to be.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:54.600
But this weakness is a brief utopia
gIimpsed by a certain young girI.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.380
Saber, Iet's destroy
the HoIy GraiI.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:10.150
Yes. I had faith that you wouId
reach that concIusion, Master.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:24.430
Fukai fukai mori no naka
honoka kaoru itoshii...

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:36.850
