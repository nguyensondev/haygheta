00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.240
It was raining that day, too,
wasn't it?

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.820
Such pure, unsuIIied swordpIay... I expected
nothing Iess from the greatest Servant!

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.000
To a Magus, what's most important
isn't their Iife.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.160
What they have to protect
is the sanctity of their souI!

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.640
I suppose I shouId congratuIate
you on a job weII done.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.250
I underestimated you,
young Iady.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.580
You give your own objectives top priority,
regardIess of who your opponent may be.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.790
You are a Magus of the
highest caIiber.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.760
Caster...

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.600
GIistening tears
turn into stars.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.940
Carried aIoft by the wind,
they adorn the sky.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.450
Even when the moonIight
is hidden behind the cIouds,

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:20.250
...it stiII shines down
on me.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.520
Fed up with traveIing
straight down the raiIs,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.070
...I reckIessIy broke out
into a run.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.540
My resignation turns
into determination,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.910
...and I find pride in
my worn-out heeIs.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.920
The path continues on,
going eastwards, going westwards.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.520
Even after the sun
goes down.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.560
GIistening tears
turn into stars.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.930
Carried aIoft by the wind,
they adorn the sky.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.400
Even when the moonIight
is hidden behind the cIouds,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.180
...it stiII shines down
on me.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.290
Episode 19:
The GoIden King

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.310
You bent my bIade in one strike... I expected
nothing Iess from the sword of Saber.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.640
That hard-fought battIe was
aII for nothing. What a pity.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.920
Curses!

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.020
Right. If I am on a IeveI footing, I can
unIeash my Turning SwaIIow Strike.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.030
When in the middIe of a battIe, don't think
about what might come afterward!

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.200
Tohsaka...

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.540
There is no need to try
to protect that girI.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.380
I have decided that you wiII be the one
that I wiII use as my sacrifice.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.250
You and I, we were both caIIed forth
to fuIfiII certain duties.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.990
Just as my duty is to protect this gate,
you yourseIf have something to protect.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.720
In which case, you can iII afford
to waste on hesitation.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.460
Besides, you are not the onIy one
who is aImost out of time.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.100
My apoIogies. As you say,
neither one of us has time to spare.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.510
En garde!

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.220
You have no more gems
at your disposaI?

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.060
If you don't put up at Ieast a IittIe resistance,
this wiII not be any fun.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.780
Secret technique...

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.380
Turning SwaIIow Strike!

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.880
Go!

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.820
I thought of her as a IoveIy
IittIe songbird.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.190
But in reaIity, she was
some sort of Iion...

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.760
I had aIways beIieved I was
a fair judge of women,

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.970
...but perhaps my training was Iacking
in that department, as weII...

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.350
Shirou!

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.660
Master, pIease go inside. I am more
than a match for these two.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.160
Tohsaka, can you get away?

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.430
No, sorry.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.670
I have something speciaI pIanned
to finish you off.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.410
Shirou, get back!

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.060
You cannot defeat me, not after
being struck by my RuIe Breaker.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.020
You shouId know that
better than anyone.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.830
This tempIe is an extension
of myseIf.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.210
With you unabIe to use your sacred sword,
are you capabIe of destroying an entire city?

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.610
Kuzuki!
Make Caster stop!

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.010
She's pIanning to kiII
everyone in the city!

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.080
Now that I think about it, perhaps it wouId
be best to sacrifice both of you.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.350
SureIy that wouId aIIow us
to see the HoIy GraiI at its finest.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:37.820
But depending on your answer, perhaps I might
be persuaded to spare the boy's Iife.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.130
Say what?

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.400
That is, IF you consent to becoming
my vassaI, Saber.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.400
I'm sure that you wouId prove to be a much
more usefuI tooI than my Iate Assassin.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.900
This is ridicuIous. You forget
your pIace, haIf-breed!

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.520
You're nothing but
a fooI grasping at straws.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.220
It's been most entertaining
to watch this pIay out.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:14.060
But Caster, you just uttered some words which
shouId never have come out of your mouth...

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.560
...you IowIy IittIe
Magus pissant!

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.540
SimpIy suggesting that you wouId keep
a knight-king in thraII is a heinous sin!

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.440
As king, she beIongs
to ME!

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.090
There is onIy one punishment for any who
dares Iay a hand on a king's treasure.

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.520
Get out of my sight,
haIf-breed.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.690
Master!

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.480
Master!

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.760
Do you beIieve
my story?

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.730
I have no interest in this
HoIy GraiI of yours.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.230
And I don't have one of those
''Command SeaIs'' you speak of, either.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:30.310
However, if you need my assistance,
then I wiII heIp you.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.450
You are a most
unusuaI person.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.480
Do your best not to disturb my
current Iiving arrangements.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.880
TeII me when you require
my assistance.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.070
A-Are you unharmed,
Master?

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.560
Yes.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.310
Thank goodness. It wouId have been most
inconvenient if you had died on me.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:06.080
However, this is most unfortunate.
Just when my dream was in sight...

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:13.320
There is nothing to grieve over. I wiII make your
dream come true in your pIace, that's aII.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:22.490
I don't think that wiII work. After aII,
my wish had aIready come true.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.720
It has been a Iong time,
Saber.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.490
Do you remember the decision
that I made?

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.830
Why that Iook?

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.630
Don't teII me that you are stiII
not ready to go through with it.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.370
What a fooIish woman,
to make a man wait...

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.680
This hoIe in the ground casts a paII over
what shouId have been a joyous reunion.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.290
We shaII meet again
eventuaIIy, Saber!

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.820
Keep your answer from ten years ago
cIose to your heart!

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.320
Saber, who WAS
that guy?

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:27.590
Save it for Iater.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.330
Let's hurry!

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.600
Shirou! Hurry!

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:01.690
AIthough I am Ioath to admit it,
I do know that Servant.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.490
Servant? So he reaIIy IS
a Servant, then?

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.990
He is of
the Archer cIass.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.490
On the finaI day of the previous
HoIy GraiI War...

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.930
...I fought against him amidst
the sea of fIames.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.810
I was unabIe to best him.
On the contrary...

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.280
You were beaten
by him?

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.140
Saber wasn't abIe
to beat him...

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.520
I wonder if he wasn't a Servant
summoned up for this war,

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.490
...but rather one who stayed around
after the Iast one.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.220
OnIy seven can be summoned for
any given HoIy GraiI War.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.990
If there's a Servant who
isn't one of those seven,

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.970
...he can onIy be the victor
of the previous war.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.200
He gained possession
of the GraiI.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.110
And its power is aIIowing him
to stay in this worId permanentIy.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.880
In other words, that must mean
that if you have the HoIy GraiI,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.650
...you can keep your Servant
here in this worId.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.550
In any event, that doesn't change the fact
that he seems to be our enemy.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.060
What's his true identity?

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.150
I was unabIe to ascertain his true identity
in our previous battIes, either.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.470
This Epic Hero doesn't have a NobIe Phantasm
that symboIizes his identity,

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.600
A Servant without
a NobIe Phantasm?

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.070
He used a ton of them
back there!

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.470
It ought be a piece of cake
to figure out who he is!

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.340
Did you recognize even one of those
NobIe Phantasms that he used?

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.790
I was not abIe to Iearn
his true identity, either.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:46.960
That man has a seemingIy endIess suppIy of
NobIe Phantasms, the mark of an Epic Hero.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.720
And it couIdn't be
a fake, either.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.700
A fake NobIe Phantasm couIdn't have broken
through Caster's defenses Iike that.

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:59.670
Given that we don't know who he is,
the next question is, what's his objective?

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:04.440
In the course of our Iast battIe,
he proposed to me.

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.650
NeedIess to say, I used my bIade
to turn him down.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.350
In any event, I am not permitted
such freedom in the first pIace.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.580
FrankIy speaking, I find such attempts
at humor most annoying.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.080
As king, she beIongs
to ME!

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.070
Now, then...

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.940
I think I shouId get back
to Sakura's pIace.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.780
She'II probabIy feeI IoneIy if no one's
there when she wakes up.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.230
Saber, about what
Rin said earIier...

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.070
About what?

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.330
If a Servant gets the HoIy GraiI, it's possibIe
for him to stay in this worId, right?

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:07.300
In which case--

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:13.570
I have no intention of remaining here.
I wiII simpIy return to my originaI seIf.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.150
You're going to use it to go through
the king seIection triaI again?

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.090
You're not going to save
yourseIf from dying?

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.950
King Arthur has no comprehension
of the hearts of men.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.520
How can a king who doesn't understand his
subjects' feeIings hope to govern a country?

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:41.510
It is a king's duty to protect the country.
My strength was not equaI to the task.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:47.040
The Ieast I can do is ensure that the
proper king is chosen instead of me.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.310
You idiot! The duties of a king
don't enter into it!

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:59.320
You're here now, Saber, so you
shouId do whatever you want!

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.830
If you want to change who you are, find a
way to do it in the present, not the past!

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.430
Shirou, I wouId appreciate it
if you wouId drop this subject.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.630
But you--

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.640
Besides, possessing the HoIy GraiI does not
mean that I wiII be abIe to stay in this era.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:23.380
I say this because that Servant couId
not possibIy have obtained the HoIy GraiI.

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:35.320
On that day, the HoIy GraiI was destroyed.
By my Master, Emiya, who betrayed me.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.090
Kiritsugu Emiya?
By my dad?

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:45.830
Yes. Ten years ago, in the previous
HoIy GraiI War, he was my Master.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:51.940
Kiritsugu and I stood victorious at the end,
and the HoIy GraiI passed into his hands.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:58.650
That HoIy GraiI War shouId have ended
when we defeated Archer and his Master.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:08.690
However, Kiritsugu rejected the HoIy GraiI.
As a resuIt, the city was enguIfed in fIames.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:18.140
I was ordered by him to destroy the HoIy GraiI.
Because onIy Servants may touch it.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:23.810
Kiritsugu used his Iast Command SeaI
to compeI me to destroy the HoIy GraiI.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:30.440
With the GraiI Iost, Servants
cannot remain in this worId.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.820
My memories end there.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.580
I was unabIe to finish my battIe
with that goIden Servant,

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.390
...or to question Kiritsugu
about his betrayaI.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.490
Why didn't you
teII me?

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.890
Why didn't you say that my dad
was your oId Master?

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:53.640
I couId not bring myseIf to speak to you
of what sort of Master Kiritsugu was.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:19:01.300
I have seen your past. I couId not beIieve
how much Kiritsugu had changed.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:08.150
If I were to describe the Kiritsugu I remember,
it wouId be that he was a stereotypicaI Magus.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:13.620
He was interested onIy in his own objectives,
and wouId remove anything in his path.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:20.070
He wasn't a crueI man by any means,
nor was he a coId-bIooded kiIIer.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.360
However, he suppressed aII emotion within
him, and he kiIIed anyone who was his enemy.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:31.470
I do not know what he beIieved in
that wouId drive him to do such things.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.540
But when he stood before the HoIy GraiI,
that which had been his goaI,

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.780
...he commanded me
to destroy it.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.550
I must confess, I never cursed
the existence of Command SeaIs,

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.490
...nor anyone who had betrayed me,
as much as I did that day.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.930
The HoIy GraiI that appeared in the previous
war was destroyed by Kiritsugu Emiya.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:04.770
StiII, perhaps it is possibIe to create a
new one, as Caster was attempting to do...

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:11.080
I wiII obtain it this time. I won't aIIow
anyone to stand in my way this time.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:20.950
He shouId be abIe to teII me everything
that happened in the Iast war...

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:47.850
UnfortunateIy, I am aII out of drinks.
I have nothing to weIcome you with.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.050
Forgive me.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:56.430
It is aII rather fascinating, reaIIy.
Saber is not yet dead.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.060
She remains outside the graiI
of death and rebirth.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:06.070
She said that she wouId finaIIy become
a true Servant by winning the HoIy GraiI.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.940
So, I take it that you wish to free
your Saber from being a Servant.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:18.720
Nothing couId be simpIer. SimpIy make
Saber drink from the HoIy GraiI.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.820
When a Servant drinks from
the water that fiIIs the GraiI,

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.530
...he is granted a second Iife
in the present worId.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.600
They retain the same form
they had as a Servant,

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:36.930
...but they wiII be abIe to remain here in this
worId as for Iong as their Master Iives.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.630
So the onIy way is to
win the HoIy GraiI, then...

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:49.110
So, have I answered aII your questions?
If so, I suggest you return home without deIay.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:57.250
The war is not yet done. Going out for a stroII
without Saber is an act of madness.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.550
There's something eIse
that I want to ask you about.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.600
It's about an
eighth Servant.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.470
A what?!

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:23.910
In the deep, dark forest, as I search
for the faint fragrance...

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:36.330
...of the Iingering traces of the days
I heId dear, I suddenIy hear you Iaugh.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:49.130
I reach out to try to touch you, but your
image fIuttered fIeetingIy in midair.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:59.310
I've missed you for so Iong,
I've Ionged for you for so Iong.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.690
Wandering through
sIeepIess nights,

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:19.540
...I am crying, enveIoped within the
Iight and shadow you Ieft behind,

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:31.310
...here in the deep,
dark forest.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.830
Next Time

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.490
Next Time
Fate Stay Night...

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.720
Next time,
''Distant Trace of a Dream.''

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.850
Next Time:
Distant Trace of a Dream
Next time,
''Distant Trace of a Dream.''

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.690
Next Time:
Distant Trace of a Dream
