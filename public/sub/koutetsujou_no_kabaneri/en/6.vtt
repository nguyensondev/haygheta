00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.250
Help me!

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.550
Help me...!

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.400
Move, Nameless.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.300
The Young Master has arrived.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.250
Yes.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.850
They're approaching!

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.050
Yukina-san!

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.450
Taking evasive maneuvers!

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.400
Aim!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.350
Fire!

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.010
Are you human or a Corpse?!

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.710
I'm neither!

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.660
I'm a Corpseless!

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.600
I will remember that day

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.600
Losing myself

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.900
In steam

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.750
Countless mistakes are made

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.150
When I can't see anything ahead

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.950
You said

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.450
"Ask your own burning blood"

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.700
Answer my beat

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.250
Corpseless of the Iron Fortress

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.200
Stand up

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.700
And slam everything onto the ground

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.950
My soul is devoted to my friend

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.650
Burn your life

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.700
Change the world

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:44.030
Chapter
Six

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:44.030
Gathering
Light

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.700
Nameless!

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.500
Are you awake?

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.050
Ikoma...

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.220
...you're okay?

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.750
Yeah... I was lucky.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.500
Does it hurt?

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.400
Yeah.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.650
Hold on.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.550
Damn it...!

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.450
Why did it come... to this?!

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.850
This is all my fault.
Go ahead and say it.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.700
Yeah, that's right.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.450
You ruined my plan.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.850
But... I was stupid too.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.650
I let go of the crane controls...
when I saw you fall.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.550
We're both idiots.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.550
I'm sure everyone's fed up with us by now.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.000
That's why we can't die like this.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.400
We have to make it right!

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.800
So we are getting out of here, Nameless!

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.400
Can't we just turn back?

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.050
There is no way we can
make it past that monster!

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.300
Could we fell back towards Nagi Mountain Pass?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.400
We won't get any speed.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.950
If it were to chase us,
we won't be able to get away.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.250
However, the Black Smoke is
scattered all about right now.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.650
Maybe it would be possible
to force our way through.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.600
The tower has been lifted halfway.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.550
If we brace ourselves for some damage,
we might be able to squeeze through.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.750
Indeed, it does seem worth the gamble.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.850
Wait.. but...

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.920
...are we just going to leave Ikoma
and Nameless-chan behind?!

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.000
Of course we are!

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.600
According to you, that foolish Corpseless
girl charged in without thinking!

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.250
She provoked the Corpses and
drew the Black Smoke to us!

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.150
What's more, the other one
abandoned his task halfway through!

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.960
They deserve what's coming!

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.250
I think that's taking it too far.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.200
Yes.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.800
We cannot just ignore the
threat of the Black Smoke.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.400
There has to be some better way.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.300
Damn it!

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.400
Just leave me already.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.950
Only the strong get to survive.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.000
The weak just die.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.050
What is that?

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.100
Then when can the weak become strong?

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.150
I said leave me!

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.300
You don't have to help me.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.250
I don't even want to be saved by you.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.300
So are you saying you're
fine being left like this?!

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.850
I didn't say that.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.700
I'm saying I'll figure it out on my own.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.700
Earlier...

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.150
...I just miscalculated a little.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.750
I'll get myself out of here...

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.750
...and take out the Corpses.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.250
I've never even been bitten
by a Corpses before.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.050
I'm...

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.950
...not weak!

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.800
Damn it!

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.450
What are you talking about?

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.350
You clearly are weak right now.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.700
You're completely trapped under these rocks.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.150
I'm not weak.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.400
You are.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.400
I'm not weak!

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.250
No!

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.900
Nameless?!

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.800
I'm turning into a Corpse.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.100
No way... is this the end already?

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.950
Even though I'm not weak!

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.050
No, I don't want to become a Corpse!

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.010
I brought some with me.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.890
I'm glad I didn't drop it earlier.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.110
You need to calm down.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.190
You're just a little hungry, that's all.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.650
When we get hungry, will we
eventually turn into a Corpses?

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.820
I don't know.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.080
But...

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.410
...everyone else in my group
turned into Corpses.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.850
I'll dig you out later.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:27.850
First, I need to take care of the Corpses!

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.000
Don't.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.100
There are too many of them.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.100
You won't be able to take—

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.200
Quiet.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.300
About what you said earlier...

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.000
We are weak after all... Nameless.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:47.900
But...

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.550
...that doesn't mean we just
roll over and accept our fate!

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.000
Over here, come over here!

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.750
Run!

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.700
They're coming this way!

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.250
Get to the Railfort!

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.340
You have been bitten haven't you?!

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.640
What are you doing?

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.600
One of you already turned into a Corpse!

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.500
That means all of you are Corpses!

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.350
Don't—

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.000
The Corpses...

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.300
...can get out...

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.100
Get out!

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.600
Mother?

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.550
Mother!

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.000
No...

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.640
No!

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.100
No!!!

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.000
Found her! Over here!

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.850
All right, pull it up!

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.450
Keep pulling!

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:27.300
Huh?

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:28.650
Where am I?

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.150
An underground tunnel.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.700
I'm glad we found you.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.500
We'll get you treated soon.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:37.950
What about him?!

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.570
You mean Ikoma?

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.500
We're still—

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.550
Hey!

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:50.700
What is this?

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.100
No way... Ikoma did this?

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.550
You have to be kidding me.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:59.070
No, their hearts have all
been pierced with one shot.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.440
That would not be possible
without jet bullets.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.330
Ikoma.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.050
Hey, Ikoma!

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.450
Ouch.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.500
Stop rocking me.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.520
Damn it.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.200
Those bastards...
bit right through my stomach.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.550
Why...?

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.050
Even though we're not strong...

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:36.800
...but the both of us are still alive.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.670
Even though we're not strong!

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.900
What is this?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.650
I'm in a lot of pain here, so I can do
without the difficult talks...!

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.100
Damn it...

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.500
Can you move?!

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.600
Y-Yes.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.900
It's still dangerous here.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.800
We need to get back!

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.150
What is that?

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.600
A fused colony.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:12.300
You know what it is?

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.330
We can talk later!

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:15.000
It's coming!

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.350
Hurry! Hurry!

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.300
What is it doing?

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.000
It's absorbing the bodies.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.760
Of other Corpses?

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.400
Yeah...

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.600
I've heard they're greedy.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.800
They don't care if you're human or Corpse...

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.900
...they will absorb anything.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.550
You said it was a fused colony.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.950
This is the first time I've seen one myself.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:58.450
Can it be defeated?

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:04.100
That's why we came back for
this Type 48 Cannon, right?!

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.150
You guys...!

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:08.350
I'm sorry.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.700
You came... even though it's our
fault that we're in this situation!

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.500
You two are just extra.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:19.900
We're only here to work because
I remembered seeing this earlier.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.000
That's why you can help
repay us by working too.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.950
I know.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.700
Hit the core?

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.650
Yes.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.800
That's the only way
to defeat a fused colony.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.250
There is a single Corpse inside it
that's become its core.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.550
If we...

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.400
So we shoot through it
with that Type 48 Cannon.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.800
No, that won't work.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.450
It will be protected by many other Corpses.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.500
Then what do we do?

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:58.700
If we hit it with the cannon...

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.300
...its body will scatter
and expose its core.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
That's when we strike.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.350
I understand.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.750
Leave the rest to us.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.750
Nameless-san, please
stay here and recover.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.900
I'll be the one to strike the core.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.500
Are you going to be okay?

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.800
I've rested enough already.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.100
I'd be too worried leaving it to you anyway.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.650
So I'll repay you with work too!

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.400
Good job today!

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.200
That hurts...

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:49.700
I'm sorry.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:50.750
Eh?

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.150
I'm sorry for saying
it was good that Taro died.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.850
Anyway, I'm going to go
take down that big thing.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.950
You can do that?

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.100
Leave it to your bodyguard.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.350
It's coming, and it's bigger than before!

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.000
Launching!

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.670
Takumi, is the cannon ready?!

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.450
We're connecting it to the boiler now!

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.300
Suzuki-san, go ahead!

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.050
Okay!

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:45.840
Finished!

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.000
I'm turning it!

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:54.960
Hold tight!

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.400
Fatty, make sure to draw it in
until the last second.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.100
What?!

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.450
"Last second"?!

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:03.200
It's coming!

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.900
Not yet...

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:11.900
Not yet.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.300
That was way too early!

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.500
Hey, give me a break!

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.800
It's my first time on this thing!

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.700
It's the Corpses!
Protect the cannon!

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.450
I'll be using the sword you made.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.150
If you die, don't blame it on the weapon.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.200
Very funny.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:47.550
We're moving up!

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:10.400
Damn it!

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:11.750
Ayame-sama!

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.630
We have to increase our speed!

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:14.700
I's catching up to us!

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.000
Yukina-san!

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.600
Releasing pressure limits.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.200
It's not going up?!

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.250
Sukari, can you hear me?

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.350
What's up?!

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.800
Something's jamming the gear shaft and
preventing the pressure from increasing!

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.700
Check it!

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.350
Huh?!

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.400
That's...!

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.250
On the other side of the link bar, isn't it?!

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.650
That's right...

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.560
The slightest touch could tear your arm off.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.670
So be careful.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:50.450
What?!

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.300
This is my unlucky day.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.180
Type 48 cannon, standing by!

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:01.950
Okay!

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.600
Don't mess it up this time, Fatty!

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.700
I know!

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.600
Fire, Takumi!

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:18.750
Hurry up!

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.150
Not yet...!

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.880
I got it!

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.050
Great job, Sukari!

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:52.450
Now!

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:17.850
Did she do it?

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.000
Nameless!

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.300
Quickly, inside!

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.150
We're going too fast!

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.350
Everyone move to the
right side of the train!

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.550
We are in danger of derailing!

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.500
Push!

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.000
Fight!

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:40.900
Even if the stars

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:46.000
That connect you make a sound

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:52.100
There are just dreams in the same rain

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:57.650
And lights are dried up

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:02.900
I am tired of getting answers

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:08.100
By mimicking others

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:13.700
Dawn without the sun

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.900
And broken morning

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:24.750
Smashed cry and dream
The ideal only has its doors

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:30.400
City is uplifted and drown in noise

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.900
I will still sing and stop turning the rudder

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:42.350
To hush silence
