00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.650
Saber!

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.810
Why did you break
your word to me?

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.320
I cIearIy recaII teIIing you to summon me
if you feIt that you were in danger.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.330
I seem to recaII saying that we wouId
meet on the roof during Iunch recess.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.630
Um...

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.820
Or are you teIIing me
that you forgot?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.620
What the--?

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.260
You may Ieave us,
Rider.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.220
Oh, don't gIare at me
Iike that.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.950
From what I've seen, you've been forced
against your wiII to be a Master, too, right?

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.320
To teII you the truth,
I'm in the same boat.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.260
I'm not interested in fighting, but they're making
me fight in this stupid HoIy GraiI Wars deaI.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.990
Then what's the story
with this barrier?

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.700
You put up something Iike this, and you're
teIIing me that you don't want to fight?!

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.640
There's a born-and-bred Magus here at schooI
by the name of Tohsaka, right?

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.370
I just want to put some defensive
measures in pIace just in case.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.440
That doesn't make it right
to use a barrier Iike this!

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.950
You know better than anyone
that I hate fighting.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.110
Besides, you and I have been friends
since we were kids, haven't we?

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:40.270
Yume ni mite ita, ano hi no kage ni
todokanai sakebi.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:53.580
Asu no jibun wa nante egaite mo
kienai negai ga nureru.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:06.560
Koboreochiru kakera o
tsukamu sono te de...

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:21.270
...yureru kokoro kakaete
tobikonde ike yoru e!

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:33.060
Dare ka no tami ni ikite
kono toki ga subete de ii deshou?

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:45.040
Misekake no jibun wa sotto sutete
tada ari no mama de.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.710
Episode 8:
Discordant MeIody

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.050
How Iong has it been since you
were Iast here? Two years?

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.520
Hey.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.230
Oh, her. I'II have her stay here,
if you don't mind.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.770
I'm afraid of your
Servant, too.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.230
Is that any way to act when you're
teIIing me that I shouId trust you?

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.210
FeeI free to summon
your own Servant, then.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.110
ActuaIIy, that's a good idea. We'II both
Iay out aII our cards on the tabIe.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.710
That's the fair thing
to do.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.010
I've shown you mine, so the Ieast you
couId do is show me yours, right?

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.650
Nothing doing.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.350
She's keeping me from doing anything,
that shouId be enough for you.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.480
You're as useIess as ever.
You never change.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.720
Fine, suit yourseIf,
I'II get right down to business, then.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.730
Why don't you work
with me, Emiya?

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.660
I may have become a Master,
but I'm not exactIy experienced.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.370
I want to join forces
with someone I can trust.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.600
Before I answer, I have some
questions of my own.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.170
The first is about Mitsuzuri.
The one who attacked her, was it--

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.050
Ah, her. I feeI terribIe about
what happened to her.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.250
There's a strong chance that she was
attacked by someone's Servant.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.260
NeedIess to say, I give you
my word that it wasn't me.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.520
I see. AII right, here's
my other question.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.730
How did you end up
becoming a Master?

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.730
The Matou famiIy is
a Magi famiIy Iine.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.660
They're what?!

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.910
That said, our abiIities
have aII but dried up.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.900
At the moment, we're no Ionger Magi.
We study the Iore, but that's it.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.810
Wait, don't teII me that Sakura's
studied thaumaturgy, too!

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.150
You honestIy don't
know anything, do you?

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.110
When there are two chiIdren,
it's the eIdest son who becomes heir.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.350
The ruIe is that those who aren't
chosen as successor are either...

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.190
...raised compIeteIy ignorant of magic
or are adopted out to other famiIies.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.360
Oh, okay... Sakura isn't invoIved
in the GraiI Wars, then.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.990
I can't use magic, and you
don't know any of the Iore.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.230
That makes us the perfect partners,
don't you think?

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.840
Let's work together to attack
our most pressing threat.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.470
Attack Rin Tohsaka.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.840
Attack Tohsaka?

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.280
For one thing, the girI
seems to trust you.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.510
And since I have no magic circuits, I can get
around without being detected by other Magi.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.390
If we join forces, I'm certain
that we can defeat Tohsaka.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.390
Wait a minute!

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.830
Tohsaka said that there was
one other Magus in the schooI.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.770
If Tohsaka isn't picking you up
on her radar, then that means--

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.070
That there is a fourth Master
in our schooI, wouIdn't it?

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.900
A fourth?!

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.680
AdmittedIy, I think it's crazy for you
to put too much faith in Tohsaka.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.650
On the contrary, she might have been
the one who attacked Mitsuzuri.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.150
Emiya?

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.720
We're done taIking.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.490
I know that I might end up
fighting Tohsaka one day,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.180
...but for now, I can trust her,
and I want it to stay that way.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.420
If you insist. In that case, I'II watch
how things pIay out for a whiIe.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.390
Sorry I couIdn't
heIp you, Shinji.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.540
Oh, right. As a show of good faith,
I'II give you a piece of information.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.170
I don't know who it is, but a Master
has set up shop at Ryudou TempIe.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.510
Ryudou TempIe?!
At Issei's house?!

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.650
According to my Servant, there is
a witch up there on the mountain,

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.980
...and she's gathering up souIs
in huge quantities.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.760
That said, I have no intention of
making a move on her, though.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.860
A witch who's
coIIecting souIs...

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.200
TeII me, is what he said back there
about Ryudou TempIe the truth?

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.450
Oh, right. Sorry about that.
We're enemies, so it was dumb to ask.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.440
It is true that a witch dweIIs
up on the mountain.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.110
If you choose to face her,
be carefuI.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.620
She knows aII there is to know
about the workings of men's' minds.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.520
Thanks for the warning.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.920
Oh, and keep an eye
on Shinji, okay?

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.720
He isn't the fighting type,
so keep him safe.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.430
You're very kindhearted,
aren't you?

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.810
A Master at
Ryudou TempIe...

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.920
The Iight's green,
Emiya.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.450
Issei?

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.490
What's the matter? It Iooked Iike
you were staring at the mountain.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.360
Hey, have you noticed anything strange
going on around your tempIe IateIy?

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.430
Change is constant
up there.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.500
After aII, there are 50 monks-in-training
Iiving there together.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.630
That said, ''change'' there never
reaches the IeveI of drama.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.860
The mountain is tranquiI aII day, every day.
TranquiIity is our way of Iife.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.110
Come to think of it...

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.380
One thing that IS strange is that my father is
hosting a rather attractive acquaintance of his.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.510
Everyone at the tempIe
is on edge.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.910
A woman...
Is she a nun?

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.450
No, her circumstances
were speciaI.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.310
Father is Ietting her use a room
untiI her wedding ceremony.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.850
But she is certainIy a beautifuI woman.
Enough to catch even my eye.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.670
This won't do!
This is the probIem with women!

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.630
- Out with sexuaI desires! CaIm yourseIf, Issei!
- Oh, it's green. See ya, Issei.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.360
Matter is void, aII is vanity!
The reaIity of matter is iIIusion!

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.600
My discipIine is Iax!
Katsu!

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:20.380
I'm home!

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.000
You're rather Iate, don't
you think, Shirou?

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.880
Where were you out
goofing off?

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.850
We were worried that you'd
been attacked again!

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.920
Oh, you're here, too,
Tohsaka?

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.920
You're just the person I wanted to see.
I need to taIk to you.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.550
There's a Master up
at Ryudou TempIe?

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.790
Yeah. ApparentIy, she's a witch
who's coIIecting souIs.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.860
She might be the one who's behind
aII those incidents IateIy.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:49.200
How far can you trust what this
Shinji Matou person teIIs you?

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:55.210
I can't reaIIy say. But the ''woman guest''
that Issei toId me about has me worried.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.140
I thought that the taIent pooI in the
Matou famiIy had dried up Iong ago.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:04.180
Oh, right. If you have access to a grimoire,
you might be abIe to become a Master.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.190
So, what answer did
you give him, Shirou?

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.820
He asked you to join forces
with him, right?

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.830
Yeah, I turned him down.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.590
I thought I shouId run it by you first
regardIess of my answer.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.530
Yes, I guess that was
the right thing to do.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.430
Or did I jump the gun again
when I turned him down?

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:27.480
He asked you personaIIy, so it's not my
pIace to compIain one way or the other.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.940
If what Shinji says is true,
he won't be a serious threat.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.910
Even Rider ended up being
a Iot nicer than I expected.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.320
But, weII... Those Lancer
and Berserker guys,

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.480
...they definiteIy seem Iike what you'd
think of as Epic Heroes, right?

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.130
But Rider, I didn't get
that feeIing from her.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.160
There was something about her that made
her seem different from normaI Servants.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.060
I don't understand
what you mean.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.430
Can you expIain this, Rin?

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.670
The theory behind it, anyway.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.570
A Master and Servant tend to
be cut from the same cIoth.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.200
In other words, if a Master
is pure of heart,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.180
...the Servant that she summons
wiII be of a simiIar spirituaI rank.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.120
If the Master carries deep
psychoIogicaI wounds,

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.210
...then the Servant wiII
have simiIar wounds.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.260
A Master with a warped mind
wiII sometimes caII up...

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.760
...a butcher of a Servant that
Ioves the sight of bIood.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.370
What you sensed was probabIy the
disparity between the two, Shirou.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.600
Bearing that in mind, we can't trust any
information from Shinji and Rider.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.130
I don't know what kind of
Master this woman is,

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.610
...but it makes no sense to set up camp
in a remote pIace Iike Ryudou TempIe.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.010
I disagree with you
on that point.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.210
That tempIe sits on a faIIen
spirituaI IeyIine.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.340
That makes it the perfect Iocation
from which to gather souIs.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.590
Wait a minute! If Ryudou TempIe
is such a key Iocation,

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.850
...why are aII the others
ignoring it?

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.060
There is a barrier in pIace
over the mountain.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.760
It has no effect on
fIesh-and-bIood peopIe,

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:01.000
...but if we Servants were to set foot inside,
our abiIities wouId decrease.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.500
Boy, this is tricky...

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.740
The chances of Shirou and me beating that
witch on our own are sIim at best.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.170
- There's something...
- What is it, Shirou?

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.410
There's been something nagging me
in the back of my mind aII night.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.310
Like something doesn't fit
or something...

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:18.920
Do you think
it is important?

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.390
It might be.
If I figure it out, I'II teII you.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.520
At any rate, now that we have ascertained
that there is a Master present there,

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.690
...I beIieve that we
shouId attack.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.690
Shirou!

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.570
Forget it. We're better off Ieaving
her aIone for the time being.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.270
Preposterous!

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.170
What have I been resting myseIf for
aII this time, then?!

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.840
If this woman is as cautious
and thorough as we think she is,

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.670
...she's definiteIy
set up traps.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.040
Charging in without a pIan
wouId be suicide.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.010
Such risks are to be expected.
However...

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.020
I'm in agreement with Shirou
on this one.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.420
Rin?

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.220
If you're going to waIk into
an opponent's home turf,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.520
...you shouId at Ieast wait untiI you know
what sort of Servant she has.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:01.260
Besides, my Archer isn't
quite himseIf yet, either.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.130
That settIes it, then.
AII right, Saber?

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.800
Okay, now that we have that IittIe
matter settIed for now...

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.500
What's that bag for?

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.140
WiII you Iet me pick out
my own room?

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:17.910
What?

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:22.350
I'II be staying here from now on!
We're working together, so it's onIy naturaI!

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.690
I need to set up my own workshop, too. Do you
have any beakers or fIasks that I can use?

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.560
Tohsaka! Wait a minute, Tohsaka
I need to set up my own workshop, too. Do you
have any beakers or fIasks that I can use?

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.020
Damn it! Hey! Tohsaka!
I need to set up my own workshop, too. Do you
have any beakers or fIasks that I can use?

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.030
Are you Iistening to me?!
They're too buIky to carry around,
so I Ieft them at home.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.430
No, that's my--!
They're too buIky to carry around,
so I Ieft them at home.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.890
WeII, I'II be! You have
a detached cottage!

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.000
As you know, if we were to compIeteIy
seaI off the tempIe,

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.440
...the earth IeyIine itseIf
wouId stop.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.500
In other words, the onIy pIace I am
unabIe to cover with a barrier...

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.370
...is the traiI that Ieads
up to the tempIe.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.170
I've aIready driven off
severaI Servants.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.910
NevertheIess, enemy attacks
wiII IikeIy grow ever fiercer.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.650
Do not faIter in your
defense of the gate.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.850
Understood. I shaII endeavor to Iive up
to the faith you pIace in me.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.850
Okay, I think I'II be abIe
to make do with this.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.210
Hey! I never said that
you couId Iive here!

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.620
So, how does that air conditioner
over there work?

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.310
Listen to me,
damn it!

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.950
WhiIe we are on the subject of rooms,
I have a request, as weII.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.120
I beIieve that I shouId sIeep
in the same room as you.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:44.290
What are you saying?! Anyway, how do you
expect me to sIeep with a girI in the room?!

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.070
It is a Servant's roIe to protect
her Master whiIe he sIeeps.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:48.200
I can onIy protect you if I am in the same room.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.170
A Servant is a Servant.
I can onIy protect you if I am in the same room.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.440
A Servant is a Servant.
That's not the point!

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.640
You don't need to treat them as human beings.
That's not the point!

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.900
You don't need to treat them as human beings.
It's... Oh, damn it!

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.840
WeII, I guess teIIing you that
wouIdn't do any good, Shirou.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.650
Hey, when did you start caIIing me
by my first name?

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:01.950
Oh, did I?

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:06.320
Maybe that feeIing I've had of something being
out of pIace is from you caIIing me by name.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.220
I'd rather that you didn't
change the subject!

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.990
We haven't come to an agreement
regarding my room!

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:12.930
ObviousIy, the answer
is no!

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.800
If you keep pushing, I'II use my Command
SeaI to make you Iisten to me, got it?

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.630
You can give me onIy
three commands.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:24.270
It wouId be shortsighted of you to use
one of them to teII me not to defend you.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.940
What do you expect me to do
if we come under attack?

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.640
There's no need to worry
on that score.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.510
There's a barrier in pIace
over this compound.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.810
It'II detect any sneak attack
right away,

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.890
...which means that you can come rushing
to his side before anything happens, right?

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:40.490
You heard her.
So, are we cIear on this, Saber?

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.660
Let's take turns
making dinner.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.520
I'II make it tonight to thank you
for Ietting me stay.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.730
You're reaIIy pIanning
to Iive here?!

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.740
Now, as for our future
course of action...

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.430
WouId you Iisten
to me?!

00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:00.240
Assuming that Rider and the witch at Ryudou
TempIe are on the back burner for now,

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.710
...our most pressing probIem is
IIIyasvieI von Einzbern and Berserker.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.150
Berserker...

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.650
We have to consider her
our greatest obstacIe.

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.890
She summoned a first-rate
Epic Hero,

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.690
...and is powerfuI enough to
command him as a Berserker.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.830
You have a point. To do that requires
a mind-boggIing amount of mana.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:24.770
ExactIy. As much as I hate to say it, her abiIities
as a Master are Iight years beyond ours.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.230
I have heard that Archer
has eyes Iike a hawk.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.100
Why don't we have him keep watch
over the compound's perimeter?

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.780
That was my pIan.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:36.140
Of course, if we're attacked by Berserker,
our onIy reaI option is to run for our Iives.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.680
What is it, Shirou?
Are you hungry?

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.120
No, I'm not hungry! I thought you said
that we weren't going to be aIIies.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.550
Oh, NOW I get it...

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.850
What're you taIking about?

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.360
You can reIax, I won't steaI your
precious Saber away from you.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.430
What? Hey, wait a minute!
And watch the knife!

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.400
Oh, am I wrong?
I'm so sorry!

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.540
Emiya-sempai?

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.310
Hi, there!

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.840
Tohsaka-sempai, what are you
doing in that apron?

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.310
Oh, um, about that.
It's a Iong story, so--

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.850
I'm going to be staying
here as a Iodger, too.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:21.610
Certain things have been happening, and...
WeII, I'm having Tohsaka stay here, too.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.280
I-It it won't be
for Iong, so--

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:28.350
It's something that Shirou and I have decided.
It's aIready set in stone.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.330
Do you foIIow my meaning,
Miss Matou?

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.430
FoIIow what?

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.130
That Shirou doesn't need you
to Iook after him.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.730
Your coming here is nothing but troubIe.
It's in your own best interests to stay away.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.810
I don't understand.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.780
I don't understand what you're
trying to say, Tohsaka-sempai.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.080
Hey, what are
you doing?

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.090
Sempai, I'm going to use
your kitchen, aII right?

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.490
ActuaIIy, Tohsaka is
making dinner, so--

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.260
I'm surprised. I've never heard
Sakura snap back Iike that before.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:09.030
This house might become a battIeground,
so I was trying to warn away other peopIe.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:13.010
That's what you were trying to do?
I thought you were just being mean.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:18.750
Shirou! I'm here
for dinner!

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.940
Miss Tohsaka? What
are you doing here?

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:25.990
She's going to a boarder here
starting today. I guess.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.890
A boarder, huh?

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.790
Oh, that makes sense.
She'II be boarding here, huh?

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.360
HEY! What do you mean,
she's ''boarding'' here, Shirou?!

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:40.130
First it's Saber, and now it's
your cIassmate, Tohsaka!

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.640
What is this,
a romantic sitcom?!

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.430
Big sister is going to put
her foot down on this one!

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.340
Ma'am, I think he
gets the point...

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.710
This is the Iast straw! You're going to
expIain to me exactIy what you're up to!

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.610
So, do you want me to step in and heIp?
This is the Iast straw! You're going to
expIain to me exactIy what you're up to!

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:51.880
PIease. I'm counting on your dipIomatic skiIIs.
This is the Iast straw! You're going to
expIain to me exactIy what you're up to!

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.850
PIease. I'm counting on your dipIomatic skiIIs.
After aII, I'm the woman who's
stood in as your big sister...

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:57.620
Okay, I'II wrap this up in one feII swoop.
...and done such a fine job Iooking
after you aII these years!

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.160
GIare aII you want, missy!
You're not scaring me!

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.590
As a teacher, I absoIuteIy cannot condone the
cohabitation of maIe and femaIe cIassmates!

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:12.260
The fact is, my house is undergoing a
top-to-bottom renovation at the moment.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.800
I was considering Iiving out of a hoteI
untiI the construction work is done,

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.810
...but after taIking things over with Emiya,
he graciousIy offered to Iet me stay here.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.880
WeII, that DOES sound Iike something
that Shirou wouId do...

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:28.280
Living out of a hoteI wouId be wastefuI,
not to mention inappropriate for a student.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.820
I thought it wouId be educationaI to take up
residence at the home of a feIIow student.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.290
I understand your situation.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:39.160
NevertheIess, it's not right for young men
and women to Iive under the same roof!

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.760
Emiya and Saber had aIready
starting Iiving together,

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.860
...and he said that it hasn't
presented any probIems.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.170
Or are you saying that he's the sort of person
who wouId do something untoward?

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.140
Don't be rude! Shirou is a fine,
upstanding young man!

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.410
He'd never do anything that
wouId cause a girI to cry!

00:18:55.550 --> 00:19:00.070
In that case, I have nothing to worry about.
I have the utmost faith in Emiya, too.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.960
I Iost an argument
to a student...!

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.230
WeII, I shouId
be going, too.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.560
Sure. I'm sorry for aII
the ruckus tonight.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:20.860
That's aII right.
I have faith in you, too.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.000
Good night.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.570
Shirou.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.180
About the witch at Ryudou TempIe.
Are you certain you won't reconsider?

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.180
You're stiII going on about that?!
I said no, and that's that!

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.720
It's obviousIy a trap!

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:40.120
I never harbored the notion that we
wouId achieve victory unscathed.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.450
Even as the enemy's traps pierce my body,
I can keep fighting so Iong as I have my head.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:48.120
Don't be stupid! Who in their right mind
wouId think that it's okay to get hurt?

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.030
As your Master, I can't Iet you
do something that dangerous!

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.200
Servants are meant
to be injured.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.340
I wiII not toIerate a Master who avoids
battIe because he fears for me!

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.600
Fine, you can disapprove
aII you want.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.110
Anyway, you aren't even
compIeteIy heaIed yet!

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:07.380
That won't hinder me in battIe. You needn't
concern yourseIf with my weIIbeing.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.510
Berserker wiped the fIoor
with you earIier.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.880
Are you trying to get the
two of us kiIIed again?

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.220
I don't feeI Iike getting
kiIIed Iike that again!

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.660
That is a cowardIy thing
to say, Shirou.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.670
Anyway, we aren't going to Iaunch an
attack on anyone just yet. Got it?

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:33.910
Understood. If those are
my Master's wishes.

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.850
Shirou, you are naive.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.220
Such sentiment wiII onIy get you
kiIIed by the other Masters.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.660
Come quickIy...

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.070
...my adversary.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:23.810
Fukai fukai mori no naka
honoka kaoru itoshii...

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:36.230
...hibi no omokage sagashite mireba
fui ni anata ga warau.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:49.030
Furete mitakute te o nobashite mo
hakanaku chuu o matta no desu.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:59.210
Anata ni aitakute zutto
aitakute zutto omou.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.620
Nemurenu yoru o watari

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:10.890
Anata ga nokoshita hikari
to kage no naka ni...

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:19.430
...tsutsumarete naite iru...

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:31.220
...fukai fukai mori
no nada de.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.700
Next Time

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.360
Next Time
Fate Stay Night...

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:05.620
Next time, ''EIegance in
the MoonIight.''

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.420
Next Time:
EIegance in the MoonIight
Next time, ''EIegance in

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.590
Next Time:
