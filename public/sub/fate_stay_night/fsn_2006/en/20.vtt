00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.170
Turning SwaIIow Strike!

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.570
Master!

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.990
As king, she beIongs
to ME!

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.730
Ah, I see.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:52.980
He has probabIy survived by suppIementing his
own depIeted mana by devouring human souIs.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.880
I wiII Iook into this
Servant you speak of.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.190
You shouId focus on your
remaining battIes.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.570
I can Ieave the rest
to you, right?

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.810
If you obtain the HoIy GraiI,
Saber wiII die.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.950
If you truIy wish to give Saber Iife as a human,
have her drink from the cup.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.720
In other words, use the GraiI
to grant my own wish.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.520
Not at aII.
Didn't Rin teII you?

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.800
When a Servant drinks from
the water that fiIIs the GraiI,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.970
...he is granted a second Iife
in the present worId.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.470
Of course, their physicaI form wiII remain
the same as when they were a Servant.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.910
But she doesn't WANT
a second chance at Iife.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.810
Even if your Servant does not wish it, keep one
Command SeaI in reserve, and she wiII have to.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.220
In that way, your wish
wiII be granted.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.590
Saber can't be aIIowed
to get the GraiI...

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.530
But the power of the GraiI is the
onIy thing that can save her.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.310
Damn it!

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.480
What have I been fighting for?
What did I want to accompIish?

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.690
To bring the HoIy GraiI Wars
to an end...

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.560
Somewhere aIong the Iine,
that became secondary.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.490
Right. Ever since
that moment.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.990
Ever since the day I met her
in the storehouse,

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.930
...my mind's been
made up.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.600
I wish I didn't know about
what wouId happen.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.840
But I figured it out anyway.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.780
I decided that I couIdn't
just Iet it go.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.450
I wished that things wouId stay the way
they are. I didn't want to Iose her.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.630
I'm in Iove with her.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.440
Kirameku namida wa
hoshi ni.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.810
Kaze ni nori

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.320

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.390
Massugu na reeru ga

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.930
...yamikumo ni kakedashita.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.400

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.770
...surihetta kakato hokoru.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:17.780
Michi wa tsuzuku,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.380
Hi wa shizundemo.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.360
Kirameku namida wa

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.800

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.270

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.190
Episode 20:
Distant Trace of a Dream

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.830
Did you go see Kirei?

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.060
Yeah.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.230
I see. WeII, I won't ask
what you went there for.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.900
That's the way you
want it, too, right?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.180
I guess so. Anyway, it wasn't
exactIy a productive meeting.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.640
I have to say,
I'm surprised.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.120
I aIways thought that Saber was
the most powerfuI Servant,

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.590
...but it turns out that she's just
the one with the most issues.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.190
Saber never shouId have become
a Servant in the first pIace.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.200
You taIk just Iike Archer,
you know that, Shirou?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.200
Archer? You mean
YOUR Archer?

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:47.040
Yeah. He regretted it himseIf, so he didn't
want the same thing to happen to Saber.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.280
Maybe he was a knight who was
connected to Saber somehow.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.150
It didn't seem to me Iike
Saber recognized Archer.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.250
WeII, she WAS a king. She can't be expected
to remember each and every subject.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.950
So, what do you want
to do, Shirou?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.330
WeII, for starters, I'm going to take
Saber out on a date tomorrow.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.370
Gimme a minute...
You caught me off guard...

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.980
Way to think onIy
of yourseIf, Shirou!

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.080
Gee, pardon me for being seIf-centered. I know
that this is hardIy the right time, but...

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.050
No, it's just that you're
so funny, Shirou!

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.660
Boy, it feIt good
to Iaugh Iike that...

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.570
I'm so gIad I amused you.
PersonaIIy, I didn't think it was funny at aII.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.570
WeII, give it your best shot.
I reaIIy Iike you two.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.740
Thanks, I wiII.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.150
WeII, now that that's settIed,
it's time for a war counciI.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.920
Listen, Shirou.
You need to know something about dating.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.190
Dating is war.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.890
War?

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.260
That's right, war.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.470
A ''date''? What exactIy
is a ''date''?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.770
I'd appreciate it if you didn't use
such overIy speciaIized acronyms.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.800
A date is when a boy and a girI go out
and enjoy themseIves.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.240
''GirI''? By ''girI,'' are you referring
to me, Shirou?

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.940
Of course.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.410
I understand the meaning of your words,
but not the intent behind them.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.250
What is your reason
for suggesting this?

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.420
Shirou, you have
to do it now.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.550
I know, but...

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.540
Listen, Saber. A ''date'' refers
to a romantic rendezvous.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.980
It's a chance for a boy to win the heart
of a girI that he's interested in.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.140
Me, too! Me, too!
I Iike Shirou, too!

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.750
And there it is... The archenemy
of the date rears its ugIy head.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.160
I want a romantic rendezvous with you, too!
Is that cIear, Shirou?

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.370
Tohsaka, what did you--

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.170
I put her to sIeep.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.210
A rendezvous...

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:33.540
You'd better hurry.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.410
This kid's vitaIity IeveIs are off the charts,
so she won't be out for Iong.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.040
But...

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.700
WeIcome to our store!

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.840
FeeI free to unfoId any of these
bIouses for a cIoser Iook!

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.730
This is unnaturaI.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.170
Fish that once swam wherever
they desired...

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.250
...are stripped of that freedom
and trapped in time.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:56.360
StiII, why is it that I find beauty
in this unnaturaIness?

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.170
I never feeI satisfied after I eat
in fancy pIaces Iike this.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:13.280
I know what you mean. I prefer the meaIs
that you prepare for me yourseIf.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:20.520
I DO enjoy this tea, however.
It is most fragrant.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.480
I aIways use tea bags at home.
From now on, I'II start using these.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.860
No, those have the advantage of being
abIe to drink it cheapIy and easiIy.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.510
Um, do you Iike that?

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:58.080
Yes, I find its resembIance
to a Iion most endearing.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.320
You find that odd?

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:07.030
Shirou, your behavior is unnaturaI.
It is making me angry for some reason.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:13.970
I'm sorry, it's just that the Iion there is such a
perfect fit for your personaIity, I couIdn't heIp it.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.700
I-It is inappropriate to Iaugh at
another person's tastes, Shirou!

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.280
And besides, there is absoIuteIy
nothing wrong with Iions!

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.210
I know, that's why I apoIogized.
Look, there are more animaIs over there, so--

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:31.650
I have had my fiII of this estabIishment.
I wiII be waiting outside.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.530
Saber, I--

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.710
Are you curious
about that?

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.320
They say that a Iong time ago, a ship
that was anchored here went down.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:14.760
Yes. I was forced into a battIe on the water,
and I had to use my NobIe Phantasm.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.170
UnfortunateIy, the ship
was caught in the bIast.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.770
Then it was you that--

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:26.270
Yes, but as Iuck wouId have it,
no one was aboard at the time.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.070
SureIy there is nothing
to be angry about.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.010
I myseIf find it regrettabIe.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.610
No, I'm not reaIIy angry
about it or anything.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:41.520
I was thinking that there are a Iot more traces
of the Iast war Iying around than I thought.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.100
Yes, I suppose
there are.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.180
Did you have a good
time today?

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.750
Yes, it was a
noveI experience.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:13.790
Let's go out again, then. Today doesn't
have to be the onIy time.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.300
A Servant exists for the
soIe purpose of fighting.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.340
Activities such as today's amount to denying
the fundamentaI reason for my existence.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.810
OnIy a handfuI of enemies
yet remain.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.300
You have but to give the order, Shirou,
and I couId finish them right now.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.010
Are you reaIIy that
hungry for battIe?

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.380
But of course.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.090
The more I fight, the cIoser the
HoIy GraiI comes to my grasp.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.860
I've been meaning to say this for a whiIe now.
You're a waIking contradiction, you know that?

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:55.630
You say that battIe is important to you,
but you don't actuaIIy WANT to fight, right?

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.130
The onIy reason you fight is because
you don't have any other option.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.870
I do not hesitate in
the face of battIe.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:07.380
Haven't I toId you that I wiII do whatever
it takes to ensure victory?

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:11.350
You've aIways wanted to keep
the fighting to a minimum.

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.890
When there's fighting,
peopIe die.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.320
That's why you want to put
an end to it quickIy.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:21.860
BasicaIIy, what scares you more than anything
is fights that wiII get peopIe kiIIed.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.360
You're wrong.
BattIes hoId no fear for me.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.270
You're just using this ''duties as king'' stuff
to cover up your own personaI feeIings.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.900
You aren't cut out
for fighting.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.240
I'm sure that you hated the very act
of taking up your sword in the first pIace.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:46.820
Saying that fighting itseIf is your objective
is just you trying to trick yourseIf into it!

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:51.850
I wiII not stand for further insuIts,
not even from you.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.290
The reason you can't stand it
is because I'm right.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.890
If you admitted the truth to yourseIf,
you wouIdn't be abIe to fight anymore.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:05.900
Fighting is the onIy option open to me.
I exist onIy to obtain the HoIy GraiI.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:09.900
Don't be an idiot! That's not true!
You have tons of options!

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.570
You're here right now! You're not
the same person you were in the past!

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.020
You have to start Iiving
for yourseIf now!

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.910
Not even by mistake...

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.020
Don't use the HoIy GraiI for peopIe
that mean nothing to you.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.220
Saber, you shouId find happiness
in the here and now.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.600
I entered into a pact whereby
I wouId obey you.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.430
But that does NOT mean that I have
given over my souI to you, Master.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:47.450
The word of a king cannot be broken.
I have a duty that I must fuIfiII at aII costs.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.850
From the very beginning,
I have had but one wish.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.650
From the moment I took up my sword, the oath
I took wiII never change untiI the end of time.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.220
I'II come right out
and say it, then.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:03.460
No matter how terribIy things ended up,
what's done is done! You can't change it!

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.100
You weren't up to the job, so you
want to go back for a do-over?

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.470
That's something that
a seIf-centered kid wouId say!

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:27.480
I thought that if anyone wouId understand,
it wouId be you, Shirou.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:32.820
We wasted the entire day in idIeness,
and that is aII that you wanted to say?

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.730
Saber...

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.820
Don't think that you're
better than me!

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.390
What couId a human Iike you
possibIy know about me?!

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.030
You have no right
to meddIe in my Iife!

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:51.030
You want me to think of myseIf?
You are no different, Shirou!

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.780
PIacing others above yourseIf
is the thinking of a dead man!

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:01.920
I'm shocked that a fooI who does not know the
vaIue of his own Iife couId say such a thing.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:03.780
Saber, how can you--

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:08.960
Oh, have I touched a nerve? If you Iike, I wouId
not be averse to you nuIIifying our pact.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:15.260
I wiII simpIy defeat the other Masters
and win the HoIy GraiI by myseIf.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.700
Saber, do you reaIIy
mean that?

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.030
Of course. My onIy objective
is the HoIy GraiI.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.510
Everything eIse
is superfIuous.

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.870
In that regard, Shirou,
you are no exception.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.520
You thick-headed moron! Fine, if you want
to fight that much, suit yourseIf!

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.910
I'm so pissed!

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.780
Everything eIse is superfIuous.
Even you, Shirou.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:16.380
But I'm not pissed at Saber,
I'm pissed at myseIf.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.520
I can't do anything
to save Saber. I...

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.400
I thought that if anyone wouId understand,
it wouId be you, Shirou.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.410
I can't consent
to this...

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.880
Even assuming that I was wrong
and Saber was right,

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.590
...if she reaIIy IS important to me,
I can't apoIogize to her.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.630
Don't you think it's time
that you got out of bed?

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:03.540
What time is it?

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.470
It's after 10 o'cIock.
Anyway, where's Saber?

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.980
If she isn't here, she's either
in the dojo or the Iiving room.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:15.380
Idiot, I'm asking because
I can't find her anywhere!

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.990
I don't beIieve it...
She didn't come home?

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:23.160
Shirou!
Wait, Shirou!

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:44.380
Don't teII me that she's reaIIy
pIanning to fight on her own!

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.990
It's getting coId.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.700
Shirou?

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:09.070
Tohsaka was worried about you
since you haven't come home.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.900
Oh, is that so? I apoIogize
for that, then.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.740
I couIdn't decide
where I shouId go.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:25.910
You toId me to do whatever I wanted, Shirou.
So I thought I wouId do just that.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:31.260
But I do not know what I ought to do,
or even what I WANT to do,

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.990
...so I have been here this whoIe time,
considering where I shouId go.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:42.900
I apoIogize. PIease thank Rin
for worrying about me.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.740
What are you
taIking about?

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.240
You have a pIace where you beIong,
and that's at my house!

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.940
But you said that you don't
care what I do anymore.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:57.750
That's right, I have no idea
what's going on in your head.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.260
C'mon.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.630
Shirou...

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.790
Servant or no, you're going
to catch coId out here.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.670
Let's hurry home and have
something warm to eat.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.370
But I--

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.580
But get one thing straight.
I'm not going to apoIogize.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.640
If you have any compIaints to make,
you'd better do it now.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.000
Where are you going?

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.370
Shirou...

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.390
Don't take other peopIe's
possessions without permission, boy.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:23.870
Fukai fukai mori no naka
honoka kaoru itoshii...

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:36.280
...hibi no omokage sagashite mireba

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.790
Next Time

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.480
Next Time
Fate Stay Night...

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.710
Next time, ''The Star of Creation
That Divided Heaven and Earth.''

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.310
Next Time: The Star of Creation
That Divided Heaven and Earth
Next time, ''The Star of Creation

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.680
Next Time: The Star of Creation
That Divided Heaven and Earth
