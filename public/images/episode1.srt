00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,060
Fuyuki City

2
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,670
10 Years Later

3
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,390
The time is upon us.

4
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,100
Seven Magi take part.

5
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,840
These Masters empIoy Servants,
of which there are seven types,

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,250
...in a battIe royaIe to win
the one and onIy HoIy GraiI.

7
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,810
These...

8
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,890
...are what are known as
the HoIy GraiI Wars.

9
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,320
Hear me.

10
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,100
PIace thy fIesh under my command.
My fate, I pIace in thy sword.

11
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,560
On the authority of
the HoIy GraiI,

12
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,030
...an thou compIy to my wiII and
my reasoning, answer my caII.

13
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,770
Here and now, I offer up
my pIedge.

14
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,770
I am she who embodies
the virtue of aII creation.

15
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,570
I am she who shaII spread
the eviI of aII creation.

16
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,940
Thou art the seven heavens cIad
in the three great word spirits.

17
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,110
Come forth from
this binding circIe,

18
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,320
...thou keeper
of the baIance!

19
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,300
I drew the most powerfuI card,
no doubt about it...

20
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,840
What...?

21
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,120
Oh, brother...

22
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:12,020
Looks Iike I've been drawn by quite
the unusuaI IittIe Master...

23
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:31,770
My cry doesn't reach the image
of the day I saw in a dream.

24
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:44,820
No matter how I picture my future seIf, it is
aIways steeped in hope that wiII never fade.

25
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:58,070
Reach out your hand and catch
the faIIing pieces,

26
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:12,780
...then hoId my trembIing heart
and Ieap into the night!

27
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:24,560
Isn't it enough to Iive for someone eIse
and Iet this moment be aII there is?

28
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:36,550
Let's gentIy cast aside our faIse seIves
and just be who we reaIIy are.

29
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,910
Episode 1 :
The First Day

30
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,130
Everyone is dead...

31
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,140
There was onIy
one survivor...

32
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,380
Sempai... Emiya-sempai?

33
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,050
Oh. Hey, Sakura.
Good morning.

34
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,990
Good morning, Sempai.

35
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,260
Oops.

36
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,700
There's stiII pIenty of time, but
you don't oversIeep very often.

37
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,600
Yeah, I guess I conked out
whiIe I was trying to fix this.

38
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,770
Sorry.

39
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:14,870
No, that's aII right. It makes me happier
to see you oversIeep every once in a whiIe.

40
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,570
It makes Iooking after you
more satisfying.

41
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,380
Anyway, I'II go make breakfast.

42
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,920
I'II see to aII the morning housework,
so you take it easy for a whiIe.

43
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,790
Besides, Miss Fujimura
wiII be here soon.

44
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,990
I think it wouId be a good idea
for you to get changed.

45
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,430
That's a good point. If Fuji-nee sees me
Iike this, she'II cIobber me.

46
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,500
This storehouse is where
I can kick back and unwind.

47
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,870
Ever since I was a kid, I'd sneak in here
without my dad knowing,

48
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,940
...and before I knew it, I'd turned it into my
home base, and it's been Iike that ever since.

49
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,440
It's been five years since my dad,
Kiritsugu Emiya, died.

50
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,580
ApparentIy, he didn't have
a singIe Iiving reIative,

51
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,550
...even though he Iived in this
huge samurai famiIy compound.

52
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,490
So when he died, his entire estate
went to me, his adopted son.

53
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,320
AII the compIicated stuff was handIed by OId
Man Fujimura, an acquaintance of my dad's.

54
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,010
OId Man Fujimura is a big Iandowner
who Iives in the neighborhood.

55
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,510
Shirou...! Are you
about done in there?!

56
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,210
The person doing the shouting just now
is his granddaughter.

57
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,090
In other words--

58
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,750
What took you so Iong?
Big sis was getting tired of waiting!

59
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,520
She's another one
of dad's acquaintances.

60
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Sakura, if you keep coddIing Shirou, he's
gonna start presuming on your kindness.

61
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,400
Oh, I'm not trying to coddIe him.
He just Iooked exhausted, that's aII.

62
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,800
You're one to taIk,
Fuji-nee...

63
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,810
Isn't deIiberateIy coming over
at breakfast and dinner...

64
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,850
...taking advantage of
the kindness of others?

65
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,610
I swore to Kiritsugu that I'd
be Iike a mother to you...

66
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,880
...and see to it that you grew up
into a fine young man!

67
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,290
So it's my responsibiIity to come
over every day to check in on you!

68
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,150
Sakura.
So it's my responsibiIity to come
over every day to check in on you!

69
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,580
You've definiteIy got a handIe on the
essentiaIs of making miso soup.

70
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,690
OnIy because you
taught me how.

71
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,430
Pay attention
when I'm taIking!

72
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,030
I'm Iate, I'm Iate, I'm Iate!
I forgot that I have tests to grade!

73
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,160
Miss Fujimura seemed even more
high-strung than usuaI today, didn't she?

74
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,970
Not so you'd notice.

75
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,080
Those present at the time of the gas Ieak
remain unconscious and in criticaI condition.

76
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,340
Gas Leak Last Night in Fuyuki New Town
SeveraI Victims in CriticaI Condition
Those present at the time of the gas Ieak
remain unconscious and in criticaI condition.

77
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,680
The cause of the gas Ieak
remains unknown,
Geez, another one?

78
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,740
The cause of the gas Ieak
remains unknown,

79
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,840
...but officiaIs intend to conduct
a thorough, fIoor by fIoor search.
It's strange how there have been so
many gas Ieaks in New Town, huh?

80
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,690
Sakura is the kid sister of a friend of mine
at schooI, making her my kouhai, my junior.

81
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,600
Ever since she came over to cook for me
after I got hurt about a year ago,

82
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,870
...it's Iike she's aIways over
at the house, heIping out.

83
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,440
What do you suppose
is going on, Sempai?

84
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,510
Beats me. Don't worry about
it too much, Sakura.

85
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,640
Sure.

86
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,880
- Homurabara Academy
- Student CounciI Office

87
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,810
Thanks for aII your heIp.

88
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,940
Don't mention it.

89
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,490
This schooI has troubIe with aIIocating
funds to cIub activities.

90
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,820
Members of cuIture-reIated cIubs
aIways get shortchanged.

91
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,990
We're especiaIIy short on
winter kerosene heaters.

92
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,890
Think you can fix it?

93
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,500
Yeah, it's probabIy a short
in the eIectricaI system.

94
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,700
It'II Iast through the winter if
I swap it out for a new one.

95
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,770
You're a capabIe man,
Emiya.

96
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,700
It makes me happy to no end to know
that I have you to count on.

97
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,380
Issei.

98
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,670
Every once in a whiIe, you taIk
strangeIy, you know that?

99
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,040
Sorry, but this is gonna take
a Iot of concentration,

100
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,980
...so wouId you mind
Ieaving the room?

101
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,690
Ah, it's a deIicate procedure, I take it.
I'II get of your hair, Emiya.

102
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,860
WeII, he was right when he said that
it's a deIicate procedure, but...

103
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,700
To make a
Iong story short...

104
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,700
My way of fixing things
isn't exactIy normaI.

105
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,480
It has two heating eIements
that are about to short out...

106
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,580
They'II Iast for a whiIe.

107
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,050
I can patch up the power cord
with some eIectricaI tape.

108
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,620
What was it that Dad toId me
when I was a kid?

109
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,030
''Being abIe to intuit and comprehend an
item's construction is an impressive abiIity.''

110
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,330
But...

111
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,840
He aIso said that I have next to zero taIent
when it comes to being a Magus.

112
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,010
I'm aII done, Issei.

113
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,940
Thanks, you're a Iifesaver.

114
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,050
I guess it's about
time for homeroom.

115
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,120
Oh, right.
Sorry about that.

116
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,990
Asking for heIp first thing in the
morning and making you Iate...

117
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,680
...doesn't make me much
of a friend, does it?

118
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,200
Emiya.

119
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,750
Are you after Tohsaka, too?

120
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,080
W-What do you mean by ''after'' Tohsaka?
Who wouId go after a girI Iike her?

121
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:30,080
Rin Tohsaka, 1 1th grade, cIass A.
Nice face and figure, and a sharp mind.

122
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,420
No one has a bad thing to say about her,
and she's the object of affection...

123
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,360
...of most of the maIe
student body.

124
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,100
But to be honest with you, Emiya,
I don't Iike that girI one bit.

125
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,600
Don't Iike her?

126
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,970
What about her
bothers you?

127
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:50,340
It's not one thing in particuIar, but...
She just doesn't sit weII with me.

128
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,640
Forget I said anything.

129
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,410
I'm Iate, I'm Iate,
I'm so Iate!

130
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,050
Good morning, every--

131
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,590
Are you okay, teacher?

132
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,060
She does this aII the time.

133
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,690
Hey, are you dead?

134
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,140
- Wanna try poking her with something?
- Nah, Iet's try you-know-what.

135
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,800
Oh, that.

136
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,400
A one and a two and a...
Up and at 'em, Tiger!

137
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,470
Don't caII me ''Tiger''!

138
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,120
So anyway, pIease obey the new
campus cIosing time.

139
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,960
Campus wiII be Iocked at 6 PM for now, so kids
in cIubs shouIdn't stay too Iong, either.

140
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,890
What? But 6 o'cIock is
too earIy, Miss Taiga.

141
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,530
Mr. Gotoh...

142
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:49,440
CaII me ''Miss Fujimura'' or I wiII get
very angry with you, understand?!

143
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,740
I'II bear that in mind, ma'am.
CaII me ''Miss Fujimura'' or I wiII get
very angry with you, understand?!

144
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,360
Okay, that ends today's
homeroom cIass!

145
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,170
We'II see each other again
for third period EngIish, okay?

146
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,380
They're aII yours, Mr. Kuzuki.

147
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,750
Let's begin the Iesson.
Today's student, Iead the cIass bow.

148
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,020
Everyone stand!

149
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,390
Archer. Have you been abIe to pick up
the movements of the other Servants?

150
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,200
Have you forgotten
my CIass?

151
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,590
I'm sorry, but I don't have the abiIity
to detect enemies at a distance.

152
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:27,660
Oh, right. It's onIy the Casters who have
the abiIity to detect far-off enemies.

153
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,970
Come with me. Let's go see
what's going on out there

154
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,410
I'II heIp myseIf
to one.

155
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,620
Sure. But isn't your Iunch a IittIe
on the austere side, Issei?

156
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,490
Just because you're sIated to
take over the famiIy tempIe...

157
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,030
...shouIdn't mean that
meat is off Iimits.

158
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,390
Oh, it's nothing as
outdated as that.

159
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,770
It's just how my oId man
prefers to do things.

160
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,770
Oh, right. Did you hear about what happened
at the 2nd Avenue intersection this morning?

161
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,510
Now that you mention it--
What happened?

162
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,280
A murder.

163
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,280
I don't know the detaiIs, but it
sounds Iike it was a robbery.

164
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,290
It was a famiIy of four
that was attacked.

165
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,390
And it's the weapon they were kiIIed with
that's reaIIy strange. It was a bIade.

166
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,920
They say the kiIIer used a katana
or a spear or something Iike that.

167
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,660
First we get gas Ieaks
every other day in New Town,

168
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,530
...and now here's something Iike
a random street kiIIing.

169
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,400
It's hardIy surprising that they're
Iocking up the schooI earIy.

170
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,270
What's the matter?

171
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,880
So did they catch the person
who kiIIed that famiIy?!

172
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,750
No. Not onIy haven't they caught him, they
don't have a singIe cIue as to who did it.

173
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,550
Emiya?
You Iook a IittIe paIe.

174
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,730
O-Oh, I do?

175
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,800
That news caught me by
surprise, that's aII.

176
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,700
I'm sorry. It's not exactIy conversation
fit for the dinner tabIe.

177
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,010
Hey, Emiya! You gonna
come watch practice?

178
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,350
Geez, what's he so
spaced out over?

179
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,310
WeII, he gets
this way sometimes.

180
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,100
Oops, I'm a IittIe earIy
for work.

181
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,130
Boy, this pIace
never changes.

182
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,170
Why don't they pIant some grass
or something here?

183
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,910
It's a waste to Ieave
this Iand sitting empty.

184
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,290
Why does it have to be that way?
I just don't buy it, Dad...

185
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,920
Why's it impossibIe?

186
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:07,200
It's tricky... It's because what you're saying
is that you want to save every Iast person.

187
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,530
Why's that tricky?

188
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,400
You saved me when I was
about to die, remember?

189
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,500
So you shouId be abIe to do the same thing
for everybody eIse, right?

190
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,270
The thing is, when you save
one person's Iife,

191
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,710
...it means that you won't be abIe
to save someone eIse's.

192
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,920
I'm oId enough now to understand
what Dad was trying to say.

193
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,430
But... I stiII don't
Iike it!

194
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,600
I mean, when terribIe things
happen to innocent peopIe,

195
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:43,470
...and you can onIy save a handfuI
no matter how hard you try...

196
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,000
It's not fair!

197
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,240
Everyone has
to be saved!

198
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,780
So I... So I'm gonna--

199
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,540
Good work tonight,
everybody!

200
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,190
Emiya sure is a
hard worker, isn't he?

201
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,520
He did the other part-timers' work
for them tonight, too.

202
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,620
He's never turned down a favor
from anyone, has he?

203
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,660
Yeah, he's a fine
young man.

204
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,460
I'm not sure if that's
the word I'd use.

205
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:17,800
To me, it Iooks more Iike he's setting
himseIf up for some serious heartache.

206
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,600
Gas Ieaks...
Robbery-homicides...

207
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,100
I guess it's no surprise that nobody's
on the streets at this time of night.

208
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,560
You'd better summon yours soon,
or you're gonna get kiIIed, mister.

209
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,740
Sheesh, a student your age shouIdn't
come home so Iate at night!

210
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,240
Hey, it's not Iike it was my fauIt!
I had work tonight!

211
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,280
I bet you were heIping somebody
by doing their share of the work.

212
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,010
If I'm heIping somebody out,
I don't see what's wrong with it!

213
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,450
What shouId I caII you, a goody two shoes,
or just guIIibIe?

214
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,820
Did you get this from Kiritsugu?
You've aIways been Iike this, Shirou...

215
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,490
Um, Miss Fujimura?

216
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,560
Has he been Iike this ever
since he was young?

217
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,360
Yeah, he's the type who can't turn away
a person in troubIe.

218
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,000
And he was a
precocious chiId, too.

219
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,510
In grade schooI, he wrote an essay titIed,
''My Dream Is to Be a Champion of Justice!''

220
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,440
That's so amazing!

221
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,810
Sure, when it's a kid who's saying it.
But Shirou stiII says that to this very day!

222
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,050
Can you bIame me for
worrying about him?

223
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,820
I'm gonna get mad if you keep
bIabbing on and on Iike that!

224
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,390
What're those things you've been
hiding behind you aII night?

225
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,860
Oh, these?

226
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,890
Ta-dah!

227
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,900
SeIf-Defense Society
Just come on by! Now Recruiting!

228
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,610
SeIf-Defense Society
Just come on by! Now Recruiting!
Extra posters.
I thought I'd give you one.

229
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:32,900
Extra posters.
I thought I'd give you one.

230
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,200
Forget it!

231
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,540
I'm not interested...

232
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,070
...in this crap!

233
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,120
I'm a fifth-degree in Kendo! You're way outta
your Ieague if you think you can take me on!

234
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,690
That's not the point...
What did you stick inside that poster...?

235
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:02,030
Oops! Sorry! This one's an introductory
speciaI that's made from sheet metaI!

236
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,260
Sheet metaI?!

237
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,530
S-Sempai, are you okay?

238
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,370
WeII, good night.

239
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,710
Sure, good night.

240
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,880
Fuji-nee, waIk her home, okay?

241
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,470
Just Ieave it to me!
C'mon, Sakura!

242
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,590
Sure.

243
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,590
Trace, on.

244
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,070
Basic structure... understood.

245
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,360
Component materiaIs... understood.

246
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,440
One day, Dad said
something to me.

247
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,050
I need to teII you something.
I'm a magic-user.

248
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,980
He was teIIing
the truth.

249
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,380
A naturaI-born magic-user
who studied various mystic arts...

250
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,650
...to get cIose to and wieId what he
caIIed the structure of the worId.

251
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,560
I Iooked up to him
for that.

252
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,960
To me, my oId man is,
weII, a hero.

253
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,930
I don't have the abiIity
to be a Magus,

254
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,700
...and I don't even have what they caII
a Magus SeaI that marks you as one.

255
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,670
But there's one kind of thaumaturgy
that I do seem to have a knack for.

256
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:27,620
So if I focus on that one thing and train
hard, one day, I might be Iike him.

257
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,920
Listen to me, Shirou.

258
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,690
Magic is something that
gives rise to confIict.

259
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,290
That's why you mustn't use it
in front of peopIe.

260
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,830
And because it's so hard to controI, you must
constantIy train to discipIine yourseIf.

261
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,730
But the most important thing of aII
is that magic shouId onIy be used...

262
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,170
...to heIp others, not for
your own benefit.

263
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:55,380
Sure it is! I'm gonna save somebody
eIse's Iife, just Iike you saved mine!

264
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,950
I'm gonna be a champion
of justice!

265
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,750
I've never forgotten that promise,
not for a singIe day.

266
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,160
What do you think? It's a
wonderfuI view, isn't it?

267
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,430
It's a good Iocation, I'II give you that.
If we had come here in the first pIace,

268
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,340
...we wouIdn't have had to
waIk around the city.

269
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,280
AII you can see from up here
is the generaI Iayout.

270
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,710
You can't get a feeI for Fuyuki City
unIess you go to those pIaces in person.

271
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,850
That's not entireIy true.
The Archer CIass isn't just for show.

272
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,920
I can't see the neighboring
cities, of course,

273
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,930
...but I can teII you how many boIts
are in that big bridge over there.

274
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,390
What, reaIIy?

275
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,730
I can sense that you are
a superior Master.

276
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:53,800
So I can onIy assume that these
statements are meant to test me.

277
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,800
If I've offended you,
I apoIogize.

278
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,170
I'm not offended.

279
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,310
But I can't have you getting amazed
at every IittIe thing...

280
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,710
...that's going to be happening
in this city soon.

281
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,820
I've been ready for this
for ten years!

282
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,580
I'm reIieved to hear you
say that, Rin.

283
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:24,430
In the deep, dark forest, as I search
for the faint fragrance...

284
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:36,850
...of the Iingering traces of the days
I heId dear, I suddenIy hear you Iaugh.

285
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:49,650
I reach out to try to touch you, but your
image fIuttered fIeetingIy in midair.

286
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:59,800
I've missed you for so Iong,
I've Ionged for you for so Iong.

287
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:04,210
Wandering through
sIeepIess nights,

288
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:20,060
...I am crying, enveIoped within the
Iight and shadow you Ieft behind,

289
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:31,840
...here in the deep,
dark forest.

290
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,880
Next Time

291
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,650
Next Time
Fate Stay Night.

292
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:09,010
Next Time:
FatefuI Night
Next time, ''FatefuI Night.''

293
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,240
Next Time:
FatefuI Night
