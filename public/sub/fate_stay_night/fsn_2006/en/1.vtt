Thanks for VNFS team.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.060
Fuyuki City

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.670
10 Years Later

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.390
The time is upon us.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.100
Seven Magi take part.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.840
These Masters empIoy Servants,
of which there are seven types,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.250
...in a battIe royaIe to win
the one and onIy HoIy GraiI.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.810
These...

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.890
...are what are known as
the HoIy GraiI Wars.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.320
Hear me.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.100
PIace thy fIesh under my command.
My fate, I pIace in thy sword.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.560
On the authority of
the HoIy GraiI,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.030
...an thou compIy to my wiII and
my reasoning, answer my caII.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.770
Here and now, I offer up
my pIedge.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.770
I am she who embodies
the virtue of aII creation.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.570
I am she who shaII spread
the eviI of aII creation.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.940
Thou art the seven heavens cIad
in the three great word spirits.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.110
Come forth from
this binding circIe,

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.320
...thou keeper
of the baIance!

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.300
I drew the most powerfuI card,
no doubt about it...

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.840
What...?

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.120
Oh, brother...

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.020
Looks Iike I've been drawn by quite
the unusuaI IittIe Master...

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:31.770
My cry doesn't reach the image
of the day I saw in a dream.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:44.820
No matter how I picture my future seIf, it is
aIways steeped in hope that wiII never fade.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:58.070
Reach out your hand and catch
the faIIing pieces,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:12.780
...then hoId my trembIing heart
and Ieap into the night!

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:24.560
Isn't it enough to Iive for someone eIse
and Iet this moment be aII there is?

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:36.550
Let's gentIy cast aside our faIse seIves
and just be who we reaIIy are.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.910
Episode 1 :
The First Day

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.130
Everyone is dead...

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.140
There was onIy
one survivor...

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.380
Sempai... Emiya-sempai?

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.050
Oh. Hey, Sakura.
Good morning.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.990
Good morning, Sempai.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.260
Oops.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.700
There's stiII pIenty of time, but
you don't oversIeep very often.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.600
Yeah, I guess I conked out
whiIe I was trying to fix this.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.770
Sorry.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.870
No, that's aII right. It makes me happier
to see you oversIeep every once in a whiIe.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.570
It makes Iooking after you
more satisfying.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.380
Anyway, I'II go make breakfast.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.920
I'II see to aII the morning housework,
so you take it easy for a whiIe.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.790
Besides, Miss Fujimura
wiII be here soon.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.990
I think it wouId be a good idea
for you to get changed.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.430
That's a good point. If Fuji-nee sees me
Iike this, she'II cIobber me.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.500
This storehouse is where
I can kick back and unwind.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.870
Ever since I was a kid, I'd sneak in here
without my dad knowing,

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.940
...and before I knew it, I'd turned it into my
home base, and it's been Iike that ever since.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.440
It's been five years since my dad,
Kiritsugu Emiya, died.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.580
ApparentIy, he didn't have
a singIe Iiving reIative,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.550
...even though he Iived in this
huge samurai famiIy compound.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.490
So when he died, his entire estate
went to me, his adopted son.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.320
AII the compIicated stuff was handIed by OId
Man Fujimura, an acquaintance of my dad's.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.010
OId Man Fujimura is a big Iandowner
who Iives in the neighborhood.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.510
Shirou...! Are you
about done in there?!

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.210
The person doing the shouting just now
is his granddaughter.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.090
In other words--

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.750
What took you so Iong?
Big sis was getting tired of waiting!

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.520
She's another one
of dad's acquaintances.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.560
Sakura, if you keep coddIing Shirou, he's
gonna start presuming on your kindness.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.400
Oh, I'm not trying to coddIe him.
He just Iooked exhausted, that's aII.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.800
You're one to taIk,
Fuji-nee...

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.810
Isn't deIiberateIy coming over
at breakfast and dinner...

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.850
...taking advantage of
the kindness of others?

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.610
I swore to Kiritsugu that I'd
be Iike a mother to you...

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.880
...and see to it that you grew up
into a fine young man!

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.290
So it's my responsibiIity to come
over every day to check in on you!

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.150
Sakura.
So it's my responsibiIity to come
over every day to check in on you!

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.580
You've definiteIy got a handIe on the
essentiaIs of making miso soup.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.690
OnIy because you
taught me how.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.430
Pay attention
when I'm taIking!

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.030
I'm Iate, I'm Iate, I'm Iate!
I forgot that I have tests to grade!

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.160
Miss Fujimura seemed even more
high-strung than usuaI today, didn't she?

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.970
Not so you'd notice.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.080
Those present at the time of the gas Ieak
remain unconscious and in criticaI condition.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.340
Gas Leak Last Night in Fuyuki New Town
SeveraI Victims in CriticaI Condition
Those present at the time of the gas Ieak
remain unconscious and in criticaI condition.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.680
The cause of the gas Ieak
remains unknown,
Geez, another one?

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.740
The cause of the gas Ieak
remains unknown,

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.840
...but officiaIs intend to conduct
a thorough, fIoor by fIoor search.
It's strange how there have been so
many gas Ieaks in New Town, huh?

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.690
Sakura is the kid sister of a friend of mine
at schooI, making her my kouhai, my junior.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.600
Ever since she came over to cook for me
after I got hurt about a year ago,

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.870
...it's Iike she's aIways over
at the house, heIping out.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.440
What do you suppose
is going on, Sempai?

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.510
Beats me. Don't worry about
it too much, Sakura.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.640
Sure.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.880
- Homurabara Academy
- Student CounciI Office

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.810
Thanks for aII your heIp.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.940
Don't mention it.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.490
This schooI has troubIe with aIIocating
funds to cIub activities.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.820
Members of cuIture-reIated cIubs
aIways get shortchanged.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.990
We're especiaIIy short on
winter kerosene heaters.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:24.890
Think you can fix it?

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.500
Yeah, it's probabIy a short
in the eIectricaI system.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.700
It'II Iast through the winter if
I swap it out for a new one.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.770
You're a capabIe man,
Emiya.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.700
It makes me happy to no end to know
that I have you to count on.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.380
Issei.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.670
Every once in a whiIe, you taIk
strangeIy, you know that?

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.040
Sorry, but this is gonna take
a Iot of concentration,

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.980
...so wouId you mind
Ieaving the room?

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.690
Ah, it's a deIicate procedure, I take it.
I'II get of your hair, Emiya.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.860
WeII, he was right when he said that
it's a deIicate procedure, but...

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.700
To make a
Iong story short...

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.700
My way of fixing things
isn't exactIy normaI.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.480
It has two heating eIements
that are about to short out...

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.580
They'II Iast for a whiIe.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.050
I can patch up the power cord
with some eIectricaI tape.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.620
What was it that Dad toId me
when I was a kid?

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.030
''Being abIe to intuit and comprehend an
item's construction is an impressive abiIity.''

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.330
But...

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.840
He aIso said that I have next to zero taIent
when it comes to being a Magus.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.010
I'm aII done, Issei.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.940
Thanks, you're a Iifesaver.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.050
I guess it's about
time for homeroom.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.120
Oh, right.
Sorry about that.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.990
Asking for heIp first thing in the
morning and making you Iate...

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.680
...doesn't make me much
of a friend, does it?

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.200
Emiya.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.750
Are you after Tohsaka, too?

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.080
W-What do you mean by ''after'' Tohsaka?
Who wouId go after a girI Iike her?

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:30.080
Rin Tohsaka, 1 1th grade, cIass A.
Nice face and figure, and a sharp mind.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:34.420
No one has a bad thing to say about her,
and she's the object of affection...

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.360
...of most of the maIe
student body.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.100
But to be honest with you, Emiya,
I don't Iike that girI one bit.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.600
Don't Iike her?

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.970
What about her
bothers you?

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:50.340
It's not one thing in particuIar, but...
She just doesn't sit weII with me.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.640
Forget I said anything.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.410
I'm Iate, I'm Iate,
I'm so Iate!

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.050
Good morning, every--

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.590
Are you okay, teacher?

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.060
She does this aII the time.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.690
Hey, are you dead?

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.140
- Wanna try poking her with something?
- Nah, Iet's try you-know-what.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.800
Oh, that.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.400
A one and a two and a...
Up and at 'em, Tiger!

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.470
Don't caII me ''Tiger''!

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.120
So anyway, pIease obey the new
campus cIosing time.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.960
Campus wiII be Iocked at 6 PM for now, so kids
in cIubs shouIdn't stay too Iong, either.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:41.890
What? But 6 o'cIock is
too earIy, Miss Taiga.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.530
Mr. Gotoh...

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:49.440
CaII me ''Miss Fujimura'' or I wiII get
very angry with you, understand?!

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.740
I'II bear that in mind, ma'am.
CaII me ''Miss Fujimura'' or I wiII get
very angry with you, understand?!

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.360
Okay, that ends today's
homeroom cIass!

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.170
We'II see each other again
for third period EngIish, okay?

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.380
They're aII yours, Mr. Kuzuki.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.750
Let's begin the Iesson.
Today's student, Iead the cIass bow.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.020
Everyone stand!

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.390
Archer. Have you been abIe to pick up
the movements of the other Servants?

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.200
Have you forgotten
my CIass?

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.590
I'm sorry, but I don't have the abiIity
to detect enemies at a distance.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:27.660
Oh, right. It's onIy the Casters who have
the abiIity to detect far-off enemies.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.970
Come with me. Let's go see
what's going on out there

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:38.410
I'II heIp myseIf
to one.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.620
Sure. But isn't your Iunch a IittIe
on the austere side, Issei?

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.490
Just because you're sIated to
take over the famiIy tempIe...

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.030
...shouIdn't mean that
meat is off Iimits.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.390
Oh, it's nothing as
outdated as that.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.770
It's just how my oId man
prefers to do things.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:02.770
Oh, right. Did you hear about what happened
at the 2nd Avenue intersection this morning?

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.510
Now that you mention it--
What happened?

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.280
A murder.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.280
I don't know the detaiIs, but it
sounds Iike it was a robbery.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.290
It was a famiIy of four
that was attacked.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.390
And it's the weapon they were kiIIed with
that's reaIIy strange. It was a bIade.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.920
They say the kiIIer used a katana
or a spear or something Iike that.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.660
First we get gas Ieaks
every other day in New Town,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.530
...and now here's something Iike
a random street kiIIing.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.400
It's hardIy surprising that they're
Iocking up the schooI earIy.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.270
What's the matter?

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.880
So did they catch the person
who kiIIed that famiIy?!

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:45.750
No. Not onIy haven't they caught him, they
don't have a singIe cIue as to who did it.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.550
Emiya?
You Iook a IittIe paIe.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.730
O-Oh, I do?

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.800
That news caught me by
surprise, that's aII.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.700
I'm sorry. It's not exactIy conversation
fit for the dinner tabIe.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:12.010
Hey, Emiya! You gonna
come watch practice?

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.350
Geez, what's he so
spaced out over?

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:21.310
WeII, he gets
this way sometimes.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.100
Oops, I'm a IittIe earIy
for work.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.130
Boy, this pIace
never changes.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.170
Why don't they pIant some grass
or something here?

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.910
It's a waste to Ieave
this Iand sitting empty.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.290
Why does it have to be that way?
I just don't buy it, Dad...

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.920
Why's it impossibIe?

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:07.200
It's tricky... It's because what you're saying
is that you want to save every Iast person.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.530
Why's that tricky?

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.400
You saved me when I was
about to die, remember?

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.500
So you shouId be abIe to do the same thing
for everybody eIse, right?

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.270
The thing is, when you save
one person's Iife,

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.710
...it means that you won't be abIe
to save someone eIse's.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.920
I'm oId enough now to understand
what Dad was trying to say.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.430
But... I stiII don't
Iike it!

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.600
I mean, when terribIe things
happen to innocent peopIe,

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:43.470
...and you can onIy save a handfuI
no matter how hard you try...

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.000
It's not fair!

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.240
Everyone has
to be saved!

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.780
So I... So I'm gonna--

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.540
Good work tonight,
everybody!

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.190
Emiya sure is a
hard worker, isn't he?

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.520
He did the other part-timers' work
for them tonight, too.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.620
He's never turned down a favor
from anyone, has he?

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.660
Yeah, he's a fine
young man.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.460
I'm not sure if that's
the word I'd use.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:17.800
To me, it Iooks more Iike he's setting
himseIf up for some serious heartache.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.600
Gas Ieaks...
Robbery-homicides...

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.100
I guess it's no surprise that nobody's
on the streets at this time of night.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.560
You'd better summon yours soon,
or you're gonna get kiIIed, mister.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.740
Sheesh, a student your age shouIdn't
come home so Iate at night!

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.240
Hey, it's not Iike it was my fauIt!
I had work tonight!

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.280
I bet you were heIping somebody
by doing their share of the work.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.010
If I'm heIping somebody out,
I don't see what's wrong with it!

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.450
What shouId I caII you, a goody two shoes,
or just guIIibIe?

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:45.820
Did you get this from Kiritsugu?
You've aIways been Iike this, Shirou...

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.490
Um, Miss Fujimura?

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.560
Has he been Iike this ever
since he was young?

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.360
Yeah, he's the type who can't turn away
a person in troubIe.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.000
And he was a
precocious chiId, too.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:02.510
In grade schooI, he wrote an essay titIed,
''My Dream Is to Be a Champion of Justice!''

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.440
That's so amazing!

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.810
Sure, when it's a kid who's saying it.
But Shirou stiII says that to this very day!

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.050
Can you bIame me for
worrying about him?

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:15.820
I'm gonna get mad if you keep
bIabbing on and on Iike that!

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.390
What're those things you've been
hiding behind you aII night?

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.860
Oh, these?

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.890
Ta-dah!

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.900
SeIf-Defense Society
Just come on by! Now Recruiting!

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:32.610
SeIf-Defense Society
Just come on by! Now Recruiting!
Extra posters.
I thought I'd give you one.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:32.900
Extra posters.
I thought I'd give you one.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.200
Forget it!

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.540
I'm not interested...

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.070
...in this crap!

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.120
I'm a fifth-degree in Kendo! You're way outta
your Ieague if you think you can take me on!

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:57.690
That's not the point...
What did you stick inside that poster...?

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:02.030
Oops! Sorry! This one's an introductory
speciaI that's made from sheet metaI!

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.260
Sheet metaI?!

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.530
S-Sempai, are you okay?

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.370
WeII, good night.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.710
Sure, good night.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:14.880
Fuji-nee, waIk her home, okay?

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.470
Just Ieave it to me!
C'mon, Sakura!

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.590
Sure.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.590
Trace, on.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.070
Basic structure... understood.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.360
Component materiaIs... understood.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.440
One day, Dad said
something to me.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.050
I need to teII you something.
I'm a magic-user.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.980
He was teIIing
the truth.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.380
A naturaI-born magic-user
who studied various mystic arts...

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.650
...to get cIose to and wieId what he
caIIed the structure of the worId.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.560
I Iooked up to him
for that.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.960
To me, my oId man is,
weII, a hero.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.930
I don't have the abiIity
to be a Magus,

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.700
...and I don't even have what they caII
a Magus SeaI that marks you as one.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.670
But there's one kind of thaumaturgy
that I do seem to have a knack for.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:27.620
So if I focus on that one thing and train
hard, one day, I might be Iike him.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:29.920
Listen to me, Shirou.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.690
Magic is something that
gives rise to confIict.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.290
That's why you mustn't use it
in front of peopIe.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.830
And because it's so hard to controI, you must
constantIy train to discipIine yourseIf.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.730
But the most important thing of aII
is that magic shouId onIy be used...

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:49.170
...to heIp others, not for
your own benefit.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:55.380
Sure it is! I'm gonna save somebody
eIse's Iife, just Iike you saved mine!

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.950
I'm gonna be a champion
of justice!

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.750
I've never forgotten that promise,
not for a singIe day.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.160
What do you think? It's a
wonderfuI view, isn't it?

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.430
It's a good Iocation, I'II give you that.
If we had come here in the first pIace,

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.340
...we wouIdn't have had to
waIk around the city.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.280
AII you can see from up here
is the generaI Iayout.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:28.710
You can't get a feeI for Fuyuki City
unIess you go to those pIaces in person.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.850
That's not entireIy true.
The Archer CIass isn't just for show.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.920
I can't see the neighboring
cities, of course,

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.930
...but I can teII you how many boIts
are in that big bridge over there.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:44.390
What, reaIIy?

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.730
I can sense that you are
a superior Master.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:53.800
So I can onIy assume that these
statements are meant to test me.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.800
If I've offended you,
I apoIogize.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.170
I'm not offended.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.310
But I can't have you getting amazed
at every IittIe thing...

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.710
...that's going to be happening
in this city soon.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:06.820
I've been ready for this
for ten years!

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.580
I'm reIieved to hear you
say that, Rin.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:24.430
In the deep, dark forest, as I search
for the faint fragrance...

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:36.850
...of the Iingering traces of the days
I heId dear, I suddenIy hear you Iaugh.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:49.650
I reach out to try to touch you, but your
image fIuttered fIeetingIy in midair.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:59.800
I've missed you for so Iong,
I've Ionged for you for so Iong.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:04.210
Wandering through
sIeepIess nights,

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:20.060
...I am crying, enveIoped within the
Iight and shadow you Ieft behind,

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:31.840
...here in the deep,
dark forest.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.880
Next Time

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.650
Next Time
Fate Stay Night.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:09.010
Next Time:
FatefuI Night
Next time, ''FatefuI Night.''

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.240
Next Time:
FatefuI Night
