00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.940
18 Hours Ago, Sky Island 15

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.250
This makes 217!

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.500
She's insane.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.080
I think the rest of us
can just go home...

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.010
The next one might sprout from inside.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.260
Have to stay focused.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.900
What's that?!

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.930
Never seen it before!

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.930
What the hell?

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.210
What is that?

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.790
It isn't a timere. A new beast?

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.820
I've never seen anything like it!

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.780
All hands, retreat.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.690
We've detected the appearance
of a new, unexpected beast.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.110
As such, this operation is hereby
declared a failure.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.790
Island 15 is to be abandoned.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.670
All hands, retreat.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.700
No way!

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.310
Hold it! What are you thinking?

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.840
I promised to return alive.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.600
I'm going to say, "I'm home,"
and feast on butter cake!

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.850
I can't let the world end before that.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.810
Chtholly!

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.650
Trees vanishing in morning mist.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.360
Milk stains. Dazzling petals. Air mass.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.320
Herring on a wall.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.370
Hedgehog standing on its
head. Organ in a bag.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.990
What the hell is this?

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.260
WorldEnd:
What do you do at the end of the world?
Are you busy?
Will you save us?

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.620
So, yeah, the new enemy plunged
the battlefield into chaos.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.940
Not only was it absurdly strong,
but we had no idea how to fight it.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.060
We had no choice but to
abandon the island.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.370
For real?

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.270
For real. So we're totally beat!

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.480
Good job hanging in there.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.120
In the end, I decided to accept
defeat and fell the island.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.410
But I must praise you.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.300
The blades you forged shone brilliantly.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.830
Seriously, this lizard's on the money!

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.040
I wish you could've seen her fight.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.920
It's all my fault.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.880
By blowing myself up, I could
have neutralized the enemy.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.700
But I said I wanted to live, and now...

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.970
You're wrong.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.970
The tactical projections failed to
account for that other beast.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.440
If you'd self-destructed to
take out the timere,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.300
we might have had to fight
the new one without you.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.770
That would have yielded
a far worse outcome.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:23.990
Agreed.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.220
We never had a chance to defeat them.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.140
So don't worry about it.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.230
Thank you.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.830
By the way,

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.520
what are you doing?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.320
Willem will feel much better
if we warm him up.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.600
I already do. Please get off.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.970
You're forcing yourself a bit.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.140
Not yet.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.260
Hey!

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.970
Say something to her, Chtholly...

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.970
It's fine.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:58.610
Uncle!

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.990
"Uncle"?

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.220
No!

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.020
She's the daughter of an old friend!

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.100
Phyr, how many times must
I tell you not to come here?

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.520
I am fully prepared to face
the consequences.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.250
I have no one but you to turn to.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.090
Someone has threatened to kill Father
if we don't cancel next weekend's ceremony

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.260
As mayor of this city, his policy is to
ensure peaceful racial coexistence.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.600
I know there are many who do
not look favorably upon that,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.660
but I am appalled they would resort
to this to impede his stance.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.080
Forgive me, Phyr. I cannot help you.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.210
Uncle!

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.440
Willem, I have a favor to ask.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.490
I refuse.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.050
But I haven't asked anything.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.720
I can guess.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.450
I'm sorry, but I'm not
about to play hero.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.840
Also, I'm already up to my
neck in babysitting!

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.500
Uh, I would prefer to
keep this between us.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.630
No need to worry.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.070
I don't know if he's dependable
or trustworthy,

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.860
but you may have high hopes for him.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.060
Right...

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.220
Whoa, it's time to pick up Tiat.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.860
Sorry. Find someone else.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.200
Please wait!

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.860
At next weekend's ceremony, my father
plans to unveil a new policy

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.570
that will open the door
for those of all races.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.530
But these Annihilation Knights
oppose this policy,

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.870
and they plot to assassinate him!

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.580
I get the feeling they'll regret
that name in five years' time.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.320
They destroy property, kidnap children,
and beat people up.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.880
They want to rid the city
of all disfeatured races,

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.170
and they'll stop at nothing.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.390
Uh...

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.400
So I wanted Uncle's help...

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.140
Not happening.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:59.690
The Guardian Wings Military's role is to
defend Règles Aile from external threats.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.900
It cannot interfere in the
political affairs of cities.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.130
Archipelago Military Charter,
Chapter 4, Article 3.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.030
What?!

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.820
But we are clearly in the right!

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.810
Being right doesn't make
use of force okay.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.030
It's the opposite.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.910
Righteousness is merely a tool to
legitimize one's reasons for violence.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.750
People like you, who really
believe in it,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.740
will clash and start a war.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.970
That's how it's always worked.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.590
But that's...

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.550
The lizard turned you down
for the same reason.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.890
I can't help you.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.780
I-It wasn't the least
bit scary or painful!

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.160
I laugh... in the face of injections...

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.240
Well done to make it through, Tiat.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.500
Chtholly!

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.320
Still a child, huh?

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.890
I am not!

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:05.920
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.130
Hey, TO...

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.880
Aren't you awfully cold to the lady?

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.840
What, is it because of her age?

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.950
Like, "girls who aren't younger
than I am aren't girls at all"?

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.600
It's not like that.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.910
No matter who I'm faced with,

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.250
I just don't want to accept anything
but the stuff I can't accept.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.050
What's that supposed to mean?

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.030
I can't explain it too well.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.760
And why are you smiling?

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.680
What are you thinking about?

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.370
Nothing, really.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.580
I don't get you two!

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.050
Something smells nice!

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.690
Look! They're wrapping meat in leaves!

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.220
That's called "wrapped ram."

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.120
I am pretty hungry, come to think of it.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.930
Want to get lunch here, then?

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.770
Wait a minute.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.000
They're clearly using too much spice,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.730
and they do not have their
permit displayed.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:15.590
I have little doubt they'll feed
you meat that is barely legal.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.840
And they are charging more
than market price!

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.780
R-Right.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.580
Come with me.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.330
I shall get you some real
Corna di Luce wrapped ram.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.300
Is that really the same person?

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.890
Maybe?

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.810
So good!

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.390
I can't stop wolfing it down!

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.680
They used less spice, and mixed
in lots of sour herbs instead?

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.890
This flavor makes it easy
to eat large quantities.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.660
I know, right?

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.950
What's wrong? You haven't
taken a single bite.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.310
Just thinking.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.720
Don't force yourself.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.520
The girls will eat any extra food.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.740
Leave it to us!

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.460
Wrapped ram is a big part of
traditional Corna di Luce cuisine.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.510
And this is the best place in
the area to have some.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:16.220
All the locals know this,
even if they're only five.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.340
Wow, local five-year-olds
are pretty nuts.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:23.680
To top it off, countless movies
have been shot here!

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.980
Like the scene in Clockwork Love and
Dreams, where the golem gets drunk!

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:28.520
Yeah!

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.220
I also saw it in Let Me Trick You,
The Return of Detective Curio,

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.440
and Howl, Lazioni!

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.080
My, how delightful! Very impressive!

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.700
Wow, our ten-year-old is pretty nuts.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:45.400
Beautiful Corna di Luce has been
the setting for countless stories.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.350
Its rich cuisine, featuring
classics such as wrapped ram,

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.780
artistry, history, and luminaries

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.540
are all very familiar to
people across Règles Aile now.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.120
You really love this city, don't you?

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.880
I do!

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.560
Corna di Luce is my home.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.600
I love this city dearly!

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.760
I love it, too!

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.900
Love it dearly, huh?

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.060
I'm amazed you can say that
with a straight face.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.150
Is it a problem?

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.260
Nah, I love it, miss.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.990
You're much more charming this way.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:22.950
I hate when people are
too casual with their words.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.840
Is that so?

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.230
Something happen to her?

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.370
Who knows?

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.970
This is the Perjurer's Grave.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:41.260
A legendary con man from around
200 years ago rests here.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.320
I've seen this in movies!

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.670
I see.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.930
"Here lies an honest man."

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:51.520
How did we end up on a sightseeing tour?

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.860
What's the problem?

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.230
We have time until our airship home.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.360
It's just, weapons like us sightseeing?

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.940
That's some special treatment!

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.280
Better thank the lizard and the lady.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.630
Locked red grimoire.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.250
Sweet cry of death.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.430
Headless clown, wandering in twilight.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:28.710
He laughs, laughs, laughs, laughs,
laughs, laughs, and laughs.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.350
...holly.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.330
Chtholly.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.560
Wh-What is it?

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.800
Do you feel sick or something?

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.800
You've been so quiet, it's like
we have a statue among us.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.560
That does sound pretty quiet!

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.800
If you're tired, tell me.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.450
I don't want to push you.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.630
No, it isn't like that.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.080
Sorry to have worried you.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.830
If the venenum generated in combat
is still lingering in your body,

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.740
want me to do the deal again—

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:00.750
N-No, thanks!

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.050
I couldn't walk if you did that now!

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.400
What's "the deal"?

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.230
And you! Don't take an interest!

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.010
Next up, we have the Lovers' Staircase.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.600
Where a legendary couple whose love
transcended social status met.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.060
I've seen this in movies!

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.290
I see.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.860
The two accidentally bumped
into each other

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.900
and rolled down the stairs together,
marking the start of their romance, but...

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.860
"No rolling"?

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.830
We can't roll?!

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:34.500
Hey.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.770
Guess it's time to set the bait.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.210
Do you like the city?

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.790
I'm really enjoying my time here.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.340
I already loved it, but I
love, love, love it now!

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.470
Really? That's good.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.770
Say, is there a fun spot where
not too many people go?

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:56.940
I know just the thing.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.820
This is the Well of Wishes.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.680
I've never seen this one before!

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.490
The Well of Wishes?

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:08.320
Like, you throw in a coin,
and your wish will be granted?

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.600
Sounds like something straight
out of a fairytale!

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.290
Sorry to interrupt your fun, ladies.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.000
We're surrounded.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Who are you people?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.720
We are the Annihilation Knights!

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.930
Annihilate! Annihilate! Annihilate!

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.530
So it's you!

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.750
Annihilate! Annihilate! Annihilate!

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:35.550
For real?

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.310
Annihilate!

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.310
Seems like it.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.170
Annihilate!

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:44.520
For all that is right, we must assassinate
the mayor for all that is right!

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:50.530
As an insurance policy, we will take you
into custody as an insurance policy!

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.240
He talks weird.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.990
For trying to put on a show,
he sure does suck at it...

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.830
Children are here! You disgust me!

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:04.540
Filthy disfeatured would never
understand our righteousness.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.040
Silence!

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.050
For the sake of all that I believe right,
I shan't ever give in to you!

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.260
Take her in.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:16.360
Wait.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:17.430
Bang!

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:21.560
Bang.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.310
Bang.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:24.810
Bang!

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.650
Bang.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.060
What just happened?

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.950
I felt your gazes all along.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.820
So we tried walking in very public places

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.190
and then moved to a desolate one.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:43.770
And you fell for it.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:46.750
D-Don't tell me, you used
me to lure them in?

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.110
Yeah. I used you as bait.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.730
I don't care one bit about
politics or justice.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.760
But I've decided to side with
you for personal reasons.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.940
After all, the little ones seem
to love this city, too.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.280
Yikes... Our TO is one scary man.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.280
A con man.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.780
That's how he really is.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.740
Damn disfeatured. Know your place.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.970
Bang!

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.120
Try to mask your bloodlust.
You're pros, right?

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.190
Damn it!

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.830
Gang up on them—

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:28.040
Arrest.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.470
Arrest. Arrest. Arrest. Arrest.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.390
Arrest. Arrest. Arrest. Arrest.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.470
Arrest. Arrest. Arrest.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.640
Willem's like a bad guy.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:49.270
Well, he is the sole survivor of
the terrifying emnetwiht race.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.110
A con man.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.520
I am extremely grateful for your help,

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.210
but I cannot accept your methods!

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.600
I thought not.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.420
Also,

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.880
you touched my belly
when we first met...

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.680
Huh?

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.780
Don't play dumb with me!

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.440
To us lycanthropos,

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.850
our bellies are sacred places that we
may only reveal to our spouses.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.180
O-Oh?

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.460
I hate you!

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.520
Thank you for everything today.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.940
Please visit again sometime.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.850
Beautiful city, huh?

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:50.580
Yes.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.310
I can see why the lady wanted to
protect her home so much.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:57.930
Yes.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.570
Well, given how much she hates me now,

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.850
she'll probably never look to someone
like me for help again.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.660
That's good. Straightforward people
like her should stay as they are.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.240
Listen to yourself.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:17.510
Chtholly?

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:21.350
The finger guns were simple camouflage.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.410
You attacked them by shooting
these coins with speed.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.080
Well spotted.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.240
I probably know your fighting
style and strength

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.580
better than anyone else in this world.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.300
Did you forget?

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:44.140
You're the one who taught
me to fight this way.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.540
That's right...

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.100
You were such a good
student, I did forget.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.730
You wanted to fight, didn't you?

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:57.820
I don't know what you're playing
at, but please stop.

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:00.620
You don't have to fight anymore.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.510
I...

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.910
We've taken on all of your battles.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.760
I'm thankful to you.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.810
I spent years of my life
waiting for death.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:21.710
All I ever wanted was to go back
to the people waiting for me.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.900
But after meeting you all,
I've changed a little.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.460
I started to want a home again.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.900
Meeting you brought me
a little salvation.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.650
And your returning alive
has brought me...

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.610
well, a little happiness.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.330
Hang on! Don't try to slowly walk away!

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.790
Don't look at me like I'm
some embarrassing fool!

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.290
Anyway, I'm surprised you're keeping
such a close eye on me.

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.180
Well, I am in love with you.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.480
Man, we can finally go back!

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.810
I wanted to check out
some more places.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.940
Well, you're a fairy soldier now.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.410
I'm sure you'll get the chance
to come back.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.320
Yes, ma'am!

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:33.330
Technical Officer Willem Kmetsch, yes?

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:35.790
And you are?

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.850
First-Grade Officer Buronny Maxi,
of the military police.

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:45.810
I see Officer Limeskin's report
was quite accurate.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:50.470
"A tall, black-haired disfeatured.
Likely has a thing for young girls."

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:55.600
If he really did, a certain someone
wouldn't have such a hard time...

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.820
There's someone I must have you meet.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.780
Come with me.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.280
No, thanks. I already have plans.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.740
Souwong Kandel.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:12.820
Willem?

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:18.040
Yeah. I can't walk away
after hearing that.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:20.130
Buronny, was it?

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.480
Yeah.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.500
Can I ask you to take
care of these girls?

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.720
Most definitely.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.480
Wait a second!

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.890
What the heck?

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.930
You promised me...

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.000
Don't go!

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.960
I have to.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.620
If you do, I'll get mad. Really mad!

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:39.560
Chtholly...

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.400
I won't let you go!

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.280
Jerk. You big jerk!

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.010
I'm sorry.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.700
I'll be waiting.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.380
I'll be waiting, so you had
better come back.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.660
Yeah, I promise.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.800
I'll come back, for sure.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.850
Okay.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.090
It's a promise.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.200
I never did say, "Welcome back."

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:32.160
