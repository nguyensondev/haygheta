00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.950
Hey.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.290
I probably know you, don't I?
Long time no see.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.730
Forgive me...

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.010
It's been so long, I can't put
a name to your face anymore.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.690
You wanted to fight, didn't you?

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.410
Yeah, I did.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.150
I believed I could help people and
protect what was important that way.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.380
But I was being delusional.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.440
I couldn't protect a thing.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.970
Everything I had slipped from my hands.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.960
Doing this now won't change a thing.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.480
I've learned that lesson over and over.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.410
But all I can do is fight.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.940
What the hell am I doing?

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:50.170
WorldEnd:
What do you do at the end of the world?
Are you busy?
Will you save us?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.180
Hey! Stabilize the ship!

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.330
I've got my hands full here!

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.840
Attention, all hands on board.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.220
The bridge and power circuits are
top priority. Defend them at all costs!

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.550
Otherwise, the ship will crash.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.230
Grit your teeth and fight!

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.930
Easy for you to say.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.240
Thanks, missy.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.020
Get back.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.760
Hey, are you okay?

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.880
We'll fight with you!

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.790
Just get back.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.490
This is my job.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.350
Oh, for...

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.330
There's no end to them!

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.450
But my sword is performing
better than it ever has.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.400
That TO's skills are the real deal, I see.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.310
My body's in top shape, too.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.290
Historia and I can do this.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:25.700
Oh, no!

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.000
Hey, are you okay?

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.150
What in the world did you just do?

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.190
How does the situation look?

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.820
Are Nopht and Nephren okay?

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.570
I saw Nopht earlier.
She should still be fighting.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.160
I haven't spotted Nephren,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.350
but she's probably guarding
the people in the hold.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.850
H-How did you get that wound?

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.990
What have you been doing?

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.310
Fighting...

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.770
Whether in the past or now,

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.160
that's the only thing
I've ever been good for...

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.400
Even you went and died, huh?

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.310
I still don't get what you meant by
"Our lives are more important."

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.620
But even so, we...

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.280
I wonder if Rhan and Ren are still okay.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.430
How long have I been out?

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.170
I'd say a couple of minutes, at most.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.460
Oh...

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.840
You would be highly ill-advised
to move around with those injuries.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.560
Are you worried about me?

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.500
I simply don't want you to commit suicide
using my friend as an excuse.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.560
Yeah, fair enough.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.400
Awfully strong, aren't we?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.840
Even unarmed, you can
hold your own against timere.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.780
You could say that.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.910
Were all humans this stupidly strong?

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.880
I used to be a brave, you see.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.560
Huh?

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.880
One of the chosen warriors
who took enemies down and saved people.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.480
It was my dream, so I trained in
the sword and hand-to-hand combat.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.800
I even learned to tune carillons.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.890
I gained as much strength as
one can through sheer effort.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.140
But it wasn't enough.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.350
The "strength" I attained
wasn't enough to help anyone.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.360
Not Al... Not Lillia...

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.720
Not Chtholly.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.620
Winning in battle isn't
the only way to save people.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.460
Sit tight for a while longer.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.710
In your state, generating more
venenum would be suicidal.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.710
Nevertheless, I'm sure that you were
a source of salvation for Chtholly.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:41.610
Hey.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.800
What?

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.870
I need a favor.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.360
The last one.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.190
No!

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.080
I think I made a promise.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.730
A promise that he wouldn't
have to fight anymore.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:58.250
And that I would take on all of his battles.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.920
No! No means no!

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.930
I want to say something to him, too.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.370
So please.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.320
No matter what?

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.530
Yeah, no matter what.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.280
But you'll definitely disappear this time.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.710
Not just your memories.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.240
Even your most important feelings.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.450
They'll all be gone forever!

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.710
Hmm, that would really suck.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.920
But letting things end this way
would suck even more.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.300
Chtholly...

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.500
So please...

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.360
Let me go back, one last time.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.820
Missy!

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.120
Damn it!

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.410
Get the bastard!

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.840
Keep her safe, no matter what!

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.260
Get back.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.520
What's wrong?

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.300
You all right?

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.940
Damn you... Get off!

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:56.000
Go away!

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.040
Please go away!

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.550
Regained control of the main rotor.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.160
Sweet!

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.160
We've lost attitude-control wings 3 through 5.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.490
And 7 is done for, too!

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.180
D-D-D-D-D-Do something!

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.450
I know, I know!

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.610
Listen up!

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.280
We're leaving this area at full speed!

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.440
All hands, grab on to something
so you don't get thrown off!

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.800
Shorty!

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.360
Hang on... I'm coming to save you.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.550
Don't.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:43.990
Stay away.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.960
The Gate will open soon.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.910
I-It's too late.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:53.900
I can't hold it off anymore.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.820
Hang in there, missy!

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.480
And hurry up, you toad!

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.320
Ren!

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.620
Willem?

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.230
You okay, Ren?

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.280
Thank goodness.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.540
I thought I'd fail to save anyone yet again.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.920
Huh?

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.880
Hold on. I'll pull you up now...

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:54.970
Hey.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.620
Shut up.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.380
I generated too much venenum, so...

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.150
I'll figure something out.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.520
The Gate will probably open soon.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.030
If it does, this entire ship will blow.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.720
I said I'll figure it out!

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:20.760
Willem, saving people is
our job, as leprechauns.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.060
Ren, what are you...

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.180
Also,

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:29.830
you've already saved us plenty.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.760
So don't worry.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.290
What... are you saying?

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.190
This can't be happening...

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.240
I am not letting this happen!

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:17.000
Okay, now this is bad...

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.420
It's almost funny how I can't move at all.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.300
H-Hey.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.180
You idiot...

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.680
If you can get up, then go hide somewhere.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.180
Chtholly!

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.860
What am I going to do with him?

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:59.120
No, Chtholly! Don't go!

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.460
We'll handle all the fighting,
even your share.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.700
So now that you don't have to
fight anymore, don't do it!

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:09.300
Now that you're free to
pursue your happiness,

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.790
go and grab it with your own hands.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:16.260
Otherwise, we won't be able
to live with ourselves!

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:19.420
Sorry.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:24.190
I definitely can't find happiness anymore.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:31.660
Because I realized that I'm already...

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.340
I'm already as happy as I could be.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.050
Books burning down.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.310
Snake swimming in the flames.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.220
Crumbling silver moon.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.930
Princesses fighting to the death.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.090
Lies of the dead.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.110
Big bell ringing.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.690
Pillar of milk pouring from the heavens.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.280
Ribbon drifting in the sky.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.270
Chtholly,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.770
chtholly

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.740
hang in there.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.230
hang in there

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.460
I'll save her, if it's the last thing I do.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.090
Chtholly?

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.370
We vowed to be together forever.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.940
And that vow brought me happiness.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.410
We vowed to be together forever.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.670
And that vow gave me peace.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.210
I realized how much I loved him.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:57.580
I realized how much she meant to me.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.190
And that realization brought me happiness.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:04.920
And that realization gave me joy.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.960
He told me he would make me happy.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.820
I told her I would make her happy.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.280
And those words brought me happiness.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.280
And those words gave me satisfaction.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.320
He brought an incredible amount of
happiness and joy into my life.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.490
She gave me so many things
I never thought I'd have.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.500
But I...

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.660
Which is why I can say for certain,

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.330
and no one can convince me otherwise,

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.920
that I am the happiest girl
in the world right now.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.410
Willem...

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.930
Thank you so much.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.290
You goddamn fool.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:00.090
No matter how many times
I experience the loss of warriors,

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.470
I can never get used to it.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:09.300
The struggle within your hearts must
have been the harshest battlefield of all.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:12.600
Well done on staying fighters
to the very end.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.900
I can't deal with this!

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.360
I told her not to fight anymore.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.150
I told her it was our turn.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.690
But in the end, she did it all herself.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.570
"I'm already as happy as I could be," my ass.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.880
Did you really think
that'd help us live with this?

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.550
You go out in a blaze of glory,
and all's well that ends well?

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.440
There's nothing "well" about this, you moron!

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:45.760
Quiet, Nopht.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.690
One's happiness is one's own
to define and decide.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.600
Looking down on someone's
decision or making it for them

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.880
is nothing but heavy-handed.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.080
Well, excuse me for having heavy hands!

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.610
Gah!

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.610
Well, that said,

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.400
if anyone can bestow happiness on others,

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.430
it's the ones who realize and stay true to
their heavy-handed natures.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.750
Spring is coming.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:27.100
Another five laps!

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:28.100
Hard work and spirit!

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.480
They're full of energy...

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.180
You can say that again.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.190
I see that those girls are working hard.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.690
They sure are.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.990
But while their beloved
older fairies are gone,

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.270
I think they're getting a bit too worked up.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.730
This takes me back.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.030
Chtholly was like that, too.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.000
After losing her older sister figure,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.120
she used her sorrow as motivation
to grow much stronger.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.380
Ah, youth...

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.680
I don't think... I could ever do that.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.060
I'm sorry, but could you pretend
you didn't see anything?

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.940
I'm not setting a great
example as the eldest.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.990
I don't see a thing.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.980
No response?

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:51.510
My pulse tracing is sure to locate
anyone, so long as they're alive.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:55.320
Black Agate Swordmaster, you couldn't have...

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:59.180
Great Sage, you have visitors waiting.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.600
I know!

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.920
O-Oh, no... I didn't mean to frighten you.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.670
Forgive me!

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.280
Listen to her go.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.180
She hasn't let go of her feelings
from her past life.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.630
I bet she's a really pure-hearted girl!

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.430
Straightforward and naïve, you mean?

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.340
That's one way to look at it.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.530
Good evening, miss. How do you do?

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.330
She isn't listening.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.440
Jeez, gimme.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.820
There...

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:52.190
See? She got tired and went silent!

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:53.870
How pushy...

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.920
Welcome, little one,

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.920
to this fragile, dying world
with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:07.020
Glad to have you.
